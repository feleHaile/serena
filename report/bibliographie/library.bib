abstract = {The emergence of satellite sensors that can routinely observe millions of individual smallholder farms raises possibilities for monitoring and understanding agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest ([Formula: see text] up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

abstract = {A wide range of methods for analysis of airborne- and satellite-derived imagery continues to be proposed and assessed. In this paper, we review remote sensing implementations of support vector machines (SVMs), a promising machine learning methodology. This review is timely due to the exponentially increasing number of works published in recent years. SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results. A summary of empirical results is provided for various applications of over one hundred published works (as of April, 2010). It is our hope that this survey will provide guidelines for future applications of SVMs and possible areas of algorithm enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {A variety of approaches are available to fill the gaps in the time series of vegetation parameters estimated from satellite observations. In this paper, a scheme considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability was proposed to evaluate the gap-filling approaches. Six approaches for gap filling were globally evaluated pixel-by-pixel based on a reference NDVI generated from MODIS observations during the past 15 years. The evaluated approaches include the Fourier-based approach (Fourier), the double logistic model (DL), the iterative interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR), the Whittaker smoother (Whit), the Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) and the locally adjusted cubic spline capping approach (LACC). Considering the five aspects, the ranks of the overall performance are LACC {\textgreater} Fourier {\textgreater} IDR {\textgreater} DL {\textgreater} SG {\textgreater} Whit. The six approaches are similar in filling the gaps and remaining the curve stability but there are large difference in protection of key points and noise resistance. The SG is sensitive to noises and the Whit is poor in protection of key points. In the monsoon regions of India, all evaluated approaches don't work well. This paper provides some new views for evaluating the gap filling approaches that will be helpful in selecting the optimal approach to reconstruct the time series of parameters for data applications.},

abstract = {The overarching goal of this research was to develop methods and protocols for mapping irrigated areas using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m time series, to generate irrigated area statistics, and to compare these with ground- and census-based statistics. The primary mega-file data-cube (MFDC), comparable to a hyper-spectral data cube, used in this study consisted of 952 bands of data in a single file that were derived from MODIS 500 m, 7-band reflectance data acquired every 8-days during 2001-2003. The methods consisted of (a) segmenting the 952-band MFDC based not only on elevation-precipitation-temperature zones but on major and minor irrigated command area boundaries obtained from India's Central Board of Irrigation and Power (CBIP), (b) developing a large ideal spectral data bank (ISDB) of irrigated areas for India, (c) adopting quantitative spectral matching techniques (SMTs) such as the spectral correlation similarity (SCS) R2-value, (d) establishing a comprehensive set of protocols for class identification and labeling, and (e) comparing the results with the National Census data of India and field-plot data gathered during this project for determining accuracies, uncertainties and errors. The study produced irrigated area maps and statistics of India at the national and the subnational (e.g., state, district) levels based on MODIS data from 2001-2003. The Total Area Available for Irrigation (TAAI) and Annualized Irrigated Areas (AIAs) were 113 and 147 million hectares (MHa), respectively. The TAAI does not consider the intensity of irrigation, and its nearest equivalent is the net irrigated areas in the Indian National Statistics. The AIA considers intensity of irrigation and is the equivalent of "irrigated potential utilized (IPU)" reported by India's Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR). The field-plot data collected during this project showed that the accuracy of TAAI classes was 88{\%} with a 12{\%} error of omission and 32{\%} of error of commission. Comparisons between the AIA and IPU produced an R2-value of 0.84. However, AIA was consistently higher than IPU. The causes for differences were both in traditional approaches and remote sensing. The causes of uncertainties unique to traditional approaches were (a) inadequate accounting of minor irrigation (groundwater, small reservoirs and tanks), (b) unwillingness to share irrigated area statistics by the individual Indian states because of their stakes, (c) absence of comprehensive statistical analyses of reported data, and (d) subjectivity involved in observation-based data collection process. The causes of uncertainties unique to remote sensing approaches were (a) irrigated area fraction estimate and related sub-pixel area computations and (b) resolution of the imagery. The causes of uncertainties common in both traditional and remote sensing approaches were definitions and methodological issues. ?? 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A model-based empirical comparison of six selected NDVI time series noise-reduction techniques revealed the general superiority of the double logistic and asymmetric Gaussian function-fitting methods over four alternative filtering techniques. However, further analysis demonstrated the strong influence of noise level, strength, and bias, and the extraction of phenological variables on technique performance. Users are strongly cautioned to consider both their ultimate objectives and the nature of the noise present in an NDVI data set when selecting an approach to noise reduction, particularly when deriving phenological variables. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Landsat imagery with a 30??m spatial resolution is well suited for characterizing landscape-level forest structure and dynamics. While Landsat images have advantageous spatial and spectral characteristics for describing vegetation properties, the Landsat sensor's revisit rate, or the temporal resolution of the data, is 16??days. When considering that cloud cover may impact any given acquisition, this lengthy revisit rate often results in a dearth of imagery for a desired time interval (e.g., month, growing season, or year) especially for areas at higher latitudes with shorter growing seasons. In contrast, MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) has a high temporal resolution, covering the Earth up to multiple times per day, and depending on the spectral characteristics of interest, MODIS data have spatial resolutions of 250??m, 500??m, and 1000??m. By combining Landsat and MODIS data, we are able to capitalize on the spatial detail of Landsat and the temporal regularity of MODIS acquisitions. In this research, we apply and demonstrate a data fusion approach (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM) at a mainly coniferous study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Reflectance data for selected MODIS channels, all of which were resampled to 500??m, and Landsat (at 30??m) were combined to produce 18 synthetic Landsat images encompassing the 2001 growing season (May to October). We compared, on a channel-by-channel basis, the surface reflectance values (stratified by broad land cover types) of four real Landsat images with the corresponding closest date of synthetic Landsat imagery, and found no significant difference between real (observed) and synthetic (predicted) reflectance values (mean difference in reflectance: mixed forest x?? = 0.086, ?? = 0.088, broadleaf x?? = 0.019, ?? = 0.079, coniferous x?? = 0.039, ?? = 0.093). Similarly, a pixel based analysis shows that predicted and observed reflectance values for the four Landsat dates were closely related (mean r2 = 0.76 for the NIR band; r2 = 0.54 for the red band; p {\textless} 0.01). Investigating the trend in NDVI values in synthetic Landsat values over a growing season revealed that phenological patterns were well captured; however, when seasonal differences lead to a change in land cover (i.e., disturbance, snow cover), the algorithm used to generate the synthetic Landsat images was, as expected, less effective at predicting reflectance. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pastoralist households across East Africa face major livestock losses during drought periods that can cause persistent poverty. For Kenya and southern Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season NDVI data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March-September for long rains, October-February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) our aim was to identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250. m-resolution 10-day NDVI composites for 2001-2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and end-dates using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most ({\textgreater}. 90{\%}) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines.},

abstract = {Image fusion is a useful tool for integrating a high resolution panchromatic image (PI) with a low resolution multispectral image (MIs) to produce a high resolution multispectral image for better understanding of the observed earth surface. Various methods proposed for pan-sharpening satellite images are examined from the viewpoint of accuracies with which the color information and spatial context of the original image are reproduced in the fused product image. In this study, methods such as Gram-Schmidt (GS), Ehler, modified intensity-hue-saturation (M-IHS), high pass filter (HPF), and wavelet-principal component analysis (W-PCA) are compared. The quality assessment of the products using these different methods is implemented by means of noise-based metrics. In order to test the robustness of the image quality, Poisson noise, motion blur, or Gaussian blur is intentionally added to the fused image, and the signal-to-noise and related statistical parameters are evaluated and compared among the fusion methods. And to achieve the assessed accurate classification process, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM) based on radial basis function kernel. By testing five methods with WorldView2 data, it is found that the Ehler method shows a better result for spatial details and color reproduction than GS, M-IHS, HPF and W-PCA. For QuickBird data, it is found that all fusion methods reproduce both color and spatial information close to the original image. Concerning the robustness against the noise, the Ehler method shows a good performance, whereas the W-PCA approach occasionally leads to similar or slightly better results. Comparing the performance of various fusion methods, it is shown that the Ehler method yields the best accuracy, followed by the W-PCA. The producer's and user's accuracies of the Ehler method are 89.94{\%} and 90.34{\%}, respectively, followed by 88.14{\%} and 88.26{\%} of the W-PCA method. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Monitoring crop condition and yields at regional scales using imagery from operational satellites remains a challenge because of the problem in scaling local yield simulations to the regional scales. NOAA AVHRR satellite imagery has been traditionally used to monitor vegetation changes that are used indirectly to assess crop condition and yields. Additionally, the 1-km spatial resolution of NOAA AVHRR is not adequate for monitoring crops at the field level. Imagery from the new MODIS sensor onboard the NASA Terra satellite offers an excellent opportunity for daily coverage at 250-m resolution, which is adequate to monitor field sizes are larger than 25 ha. A field study was conducted in the predominantly corn and soybean area of Iowa to evaluate the applicability of the 8-day MODIS composite imagery in operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate the models. The MODIS data was used in a radiative transfer model to estimate LAI through the season. LAI was integrated into a climate-based crop simulation model to scale from local simulation of crop development and responses to a regional scale. Simulations of corn and soybean yields at a 1.6×1.6-km2grid scale were comparable to county yields reported by the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Weekly changes in soil moisture for the top 1-m profile were also simulated as part of the crop model as one of the critical parameters influencing crop condition and yields. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It has been applied in modelling experiments for terrestrial ecosystems at the global, continental, and regional scales. But some PAL NDVI time series remain significant residual effects and noise levels. A simple method, the mean-value iteration filter (MVI), has been developed to reduce the noise and to enable the reconstruction of high quality NDVI time-series. A comparison between the newly developed method and other existing methods (the modified BISE algorithm and a fast Fourier transform algorithm) indicates that the newly developed method is an effective tool for reconstructing high-quality time series of PAL NDVI time series. {\textcopyright} 2005 COSPAR.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to soil background and atmospheric effects has generated an increasing interest in the development of new indices, such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI), atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), global environment monitoring index (GEMI) modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), which are less sensitive to these external influences. These indices are theoretically more reliable than NDVI, although they are not yet widely used with satellite data. This article focuses on testing and comparing the sensitivity of NDVI, SAVI, TSAVI, MSAVI and GEMI to soil background effects. Indices are simulated with the SAIL model for a large range of soil reflectances, including sand, clay, and dark peat, with additional variations induced by moisture and roughness. The general formulation of the SAVI family of indices with the form VI = (NIR - R)/(NIR + R + X) is also reexamined. The value of the parameter X is critical in the minimization of soil effects. A value of X = 0.16 is found as the optimized value. Index performances are compared by means of an analysis of variance.},

abstract = {A multi-resolution analysis (MRA) based on the wavelet transform (WT) has been implemented to study NDVI time series. These series, which are non-stationary and present short-term, seasonal and long-term variations, can be decomposed using this MRA as a sum of series associated with different temporal scales. The main focus of the paper is to check the potential of this MRA to capture and describe both intra- and inter-annual changes in the data, i.e., to discuss the ability of the proposed procedure to monitor vegetation dynamics at regional scale. Our approach concentrates on what wavelet analysis can tell us about a NDVI time series. On the one hand, the intra-annual series, linked to the seasonality, has been used to estimate different key features related to the vegetation phenology, which depend on the vegetation cover type. On the other hand, the inter-annual series has been used to identify the trend, which is related to land-cover changes, and a Mann-Kendall test has been applied to confirm the significance of the observed trends. NDVI images from the MEDOKADS (Mediterranean Extended Daily One-km AVHRR Data Set) imagery series over Spain are processed according to a per-pixel strategy for this study. Results show that the wavelet analysis provides relevant information about vegetation dynamics at regional scale, such as the mean and minimum NDVI value, the amplitude of the phenological cycle, the timing of the maximum NDVI and the magnitude of the land-cover change. The latter, in combination with precipitation data, has been used to interpret the observed land-cover changes and identify those subtle changes associated to land degradation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Three Landsat7 ETM+ images acquired in May, July and August during the 2000 crop growing season were used for field-based mapping of summer crops in Karacabey, Turkey. First, the classification of each image date was performed on a standard per pixel basis. The results of per pixel classification were integrated with digital agricultural field boundaries and a crop type was determined for each field based on the modal class calculated within the field. The classification accuracy was computed by comparing the reference data, field-by-field, to each classified image. The individual crop accuracies were examined on each classified data and those crops whose accuracy exceeds a preset threshold level were determined. A sequential masking classification procedure was then performed using the three image dates, excluding after each classification the class properly classified. The final classified data were analysed on a field basis to assign each field a class label. An immediate update of the database was provided by directly entering the results of the analysis into the database. The sequential masking procedure for field-based crop mapping improved the overall accuracies of the classifications of the July and August images alone by more than 10},

abstract = {Land cover fractions (LCFs) derived through spectral mixture analysis are useful in understanding sub-pixel information. However, few studies have been conducted on the analysis of time-series LCFs. Although multi-scale comparisons of spectral index, hard classification, and land surface temperature images have received attention, rarely have these approaches been applied to LCFs. This study compared the LCFs derived through Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) using the time-series Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired in the Poyang Lake area, China between 2004 and 2005. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) propose an approach for optimal endmember (EM) selection in time-series MESMA; (2) understand the trends in time-series LCFs derived from the TM and MODIS data; and (3) examine the trends in the correlation between the bi-scale LCFs derived from the time-series TM and MODIS data. Our results indicated: (1) the EM spectra chosen according to the proposed hierarchical three-step approach (overall, seasonal, and individual) accurately modeled the both the TM and MODIS images; (2) green vegetation (GV) and NPV/soil/impervious surface (N/S/I) classes followed sine curve trends in the overall area, while the two water classes displayed the water level change pattern in the areas primarily covered with wetland vegetation; and (3) GV, N/S/I, and bright water classes indicated a moderately high agreement between the TM and MODIS LCFs in the whole area (adjusted R 2???0.6). However, low levels of correlations were found in the areas primarily dominated by wetland vegetation for all land cover classes. ?? 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {The global environmental change research community requires improved and up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) datasets at regional to global scales to support a variety of science and policy applications. Considerable strides have been made to improve large-area LULC datasets, but little emphasis has been placed on thematically detailed crop mapping, despite the considerable influence of management activities in the cropland sector on various environmental processes and the economy. Time-series MODIS 250??m Vegetation Index (VI) datasets hold considerable promise for large-area crop mapping in an agriculturally intensive region such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, given their global coverage, intermediate spatial resolution, high temporal resolution (16-day composite period), and cost-free status. However, the specific spectral-temporal information contained in these data has yet to be thoroughly explored and their applicability for large-area crop-related LULC classification is relatively unknown. The objective of this research was to investigate the general applicability of the time-series MODIS 250??m Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets for crop-related LULC classification in this region. A combination of graphical and statistical analyses were performed on a 12-month time-series of MODIS EVI and NDVI data from more than 2000 cropped field sites across the U.S. state of Kansas. Both MODIS VI datasets were found to have sufficient spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions to detect unique multi-temporal signatures for each of the region's major crop types (alfalfa, corn, sorghum, soybeans, and winter wheat) and management practices (double crop, fallow, and irrigation). Each crop's multi-temporal VI signature was consistent with its general phenological characteristics and most crop classes were spectrally separable at some point during the growing season. Regional intra-class VI signature variations were found for some crops across Kansas that reflected the state's climate and planting time differences. The multi-temporal EVI and NDVI data tracked similar seasonal responses for all crops and were highly correlated across the growing season. However, differences between EVI and NDVI responses were most pronounced during the senescence phase of the growing season. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Similar result was also obtained using principal components of multidate data. Inclusion of data acquired during the transitional phase of crop seasons was found to improve classification accuracy. Four-date data acquired between October and March were found to be optimum for deriving such information for West Bengal. The results showed that a rice based single cropping system is the dominant rotation class of the district, while in the irrigation command area of Damodar river, a double cropping system of rice followed by rice and rice followed by potato were the major rotation classes.},

abstract = {For remote sensing to be useful for analyzing crop yield gaps, methods should be accurate at the field scale without need for local ground calibration. We used an extensive field-level data set of on-farm yields from 134 irrigated and 94 rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Nebraska during a 4-yr period to evaluate three methods that do not require ground-based calibration. The first method is based on summing estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, the second on using either MODIS or Landsat data to calibrate a crop model (Hybrid-Maize), and the third using Hybrid-Maize simulations to train a simple regression, which is then applied to MODIS or Landsat data. For MODIS, all three methods performed similarly poorly at predicting maize yields, with an R-2 between observed and predicted yields of roughly 0.10 for rainfed and 0.20 for irrigated fields. Estimates from Landsat were considerably more accurate, with up to 20{\%} of rainfed and 50{\%} of irrigated yield variation captured by the predictions. Across all methods and sensors, irrigated yield variations were more successfully captured than rainfed yields because of relatively smaller rainfed field sizes and the added difficulty of modeling crop water stress in rainfed fields. Agreement between observed and predicted yields was highest for the third approach, which is attractive because it leverages a crop model's ability to synthesize knowledge on crop physiology and year-to-year differences in weather throughout the season, yet produces a simple regression that can be rapidly applied to Landsat imagery.},

Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies.

abstract = {Although the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data, derived from NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/VEGETATION, TERRA or AQUA/MODIS, has been successfully used in research regarding global environmental change, residual noise in the NDVI time-series data, even after applying strict pre-processing, impedes further analysis and risks generating erroneous results. Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Crop mapping is one major component of agricultural resource monitoring using remote sensing. Yield or water demand modeling requires that both, the total surface that is cultivated and the accurate distribution of crops, respectively is known. Map quality is crucial and influences the model outputs. Although the use of multi-spectral time series data in crop mapping has been acknowledged, the potentially high dimensionality of the input data remains an issue. In this study Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for crop classification in irrigated landscapes at the object-level. Input to the classifications is 71 multi-seasonal spectral and geostatistical features computed from RapidEye time series. The random forest (RF) feature importance score was used to select a subset of features that achieved optimal accuracies. The relationship between the hard result accuracy and the soft output from the SVM is investigated by employing two measures of uncertainty, the maximum a posteriori probability and the alpha quadratic entropy. Specifically the effect of feature selection on map uncertainty is investigated by looking at the soft outputs of the SVM, in addition to classical accuracy metrics. Overall the SVMs applied to the reduced feature subspaces that were composed of the most informative multi-seasonal features led to a clear increase in classification accuracy up to 4.3{\%}, and to a significant decline in thematic uncertainty. SVM was shown to be affected by feature space size and could benefit from RF-based feature selection. Uncertainty measures from SVM are an informative source of information on the spatial distribution of error in the crop maps. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {From in situ measured woody cover we develop a phenology driven model to estimate the canopy cover of woody species in the Sahelian drylands at 1km scale. The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - VEGETATION (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual FAPAR dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel. Both multi-year field data and satellite metrics are averaged to produce a steady map. Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r2/RMSE (in {\%} woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/3.2 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of drylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.},

abstract = {New advances in satellite data acquisition and processing offer promise for monitoring agricultural lands globally. Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the "best" dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14-58{\%} and an average of 35{\%} for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32{\%} of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.},

abstract = {A semi-physical fusion approach that uses the MODIS BRDF/Albedo land surface characterization product and Landsat ETM+ data to predict ETM+ reflectance on the same, an antecedent, or subsequent date is presented. The method may be used for ETM+ cloud/cloud shadow and SLC-off gap filling and for relative radiometric normalization. It is demonstrated over three study sites, one in Africa and two in the U.S. (Oregon and Idaho) that were selected to encompass a range of land cover land use types and temporal variations in solar illumination, land cover, land use, and phenology. Specifically, the 30??m ETM+ spectral reflectance is predicted for a desired date as the product of observed ETM+ reflectance and the ratio of the 500??m surface reflectance modeled using the MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters and the sun-sensor geometry on the predicted and observed Landsat dates. The difference between the predicted and observed ETM+ reflectance (prediction residual) is compared with the difference between the ETM+ reflectance observed on the two dates (temporal residual) and with respect to the MODIS BRDF model parameter quality. For all three scenes, and all but the shortest wavelength band, the mean prediction residual is smaller than the mean temporal residual, by up to a factor of three. The accuracy is typically higher at ETM+ pixel locations where the MODIS BRDF model parameters are derived using the best quality inversions. The method is most accurate for the ETM+ near-infrared (NIR) band; mean NIR prediction residuals are 9{\%}, 12{\%} and 14{\%} of the mean NIR scene reflectance of the African, Oregon and Idaho sites respectively. The developed fusion approach may be applied to any high spatial resolution satellite data, does not require any tuning parameters and so may be automated, is applied on a per-pixel basis and is unaffected by the presence of missing or contaminated neighboring Landsat pixels, accommodates for temporal variations due to surface changes (e.g., phenological, land cover/land use variations) observable at the 500??m MODIS BRDF/Albedo product resolution, and allows for future improvements through BRDF model refinement and error assessment. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Information of crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop productivity and crop management. Therefore we developed a new method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice. The method consists of three procedures: (i) prescription of multi-temporal MODIS/Terra data; (ii) filtering time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data by time-frequency analysis; and (iii) specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed EVI time profile. Applying this method to MODIS data, we determined the planting date, heading date, harvesting date, and growing period in 2002. And we validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 30 paddy fields. As for the filtering, we adopted wavelet and Fourier transforms. Three types of mother wavelet (Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet) were used in Wavelet transform. As the results of validation, the wavelet transform performed better than the Fourier transform. Specifically, the case using Coiflet (order = 4) gave remarkably good results in determining phenological stages and growing periods. The root mean square errors of the estimated phenological dates against the statistical data were: 12.1 days for planting date, 9.0 days for heading date, 10.6 days for harvesting date, and 11.0 days for growing period. The method using wavelet transform with Coiflet (order = 4) allows the determination of regional characteristics of rice phenology. We proposed this new method using the wavelet transform; Wavelet based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The goals of this research are to assess wavelet algorithms applied to MODIS time series to determine expansion of row-crops and intensification of the number of crops grown. MODIS provides data from February 2000 to present, a period of agricultural expansion and intensification in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We have selected a study area near Comodoro, Mato Grosso because of the rapid growth of row-crop agriculture and availability of ground truth data of agricultural land-use history. We used a 90{\%} power wavelet transform to create a wavelet-smoothed time series for five years of MODIS EVI data. From this wavelet-smoothed time series we determine characteristic phenology of single and double crops. We estimate that over 3200??km2 were converted from native vegetation and pasture to row-crop agriculture from 2000 to 2005 in our study area encompassing 40,000??km2. We observe an increase of 2000??km2 of agricultural intensification, where areas of single crops were converted to double crops during the study period. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Although the spatial resolution of MODIS data is not very high, it is still useful for detecting very large-scale phenomenon, such as changes in seasonal vegetation patterns. After the data processing a general crop-related LULC (land use and land cover) map, cropping intensity map and cropping patterns map were produced. Analysis of these maps showed that the main land use type in the study area was farmland, most of which was dominated by rice. Rice fields mostly concentrated in the flood plains and double or triple rice-cropping system was commonly employed in this area. Maize, cassava, sugarcane and other upland crops were mainly distributed in the high alluvial terraces. Because these area often have water shortage problem particularly in the dry season which can support only one crop in a year, the cropping intensity was very low. However, some upland areas can be cultivated twice a year with crops which have short growing seasons. The crop information extracted from MODIS data sets were assessed by CBERS data, statistic data and so on. It was shown that MODIS derived crop information coincided well with the statistic data at the provincial level. At the same time, crop information extracted by MODIS data sets and CBERS were compared with each other which also showed similar spatial patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009 COSPAR.},

abstract = {Soil fertility in smallholder farming areas is known to vary strongly on multiple scales. This study measures the sensitivity of the recorded satellite signal to on-farm soil fertility treatments applied to five crop types, and quantifies this fertilization effect with respect to within-field variation, between-field variation and field position in the catena. Plant growth was assessed in 5–6 plots per field in 48 fields located in the Sudano-Sahelian agro-ecological zone of southeastern Mali. A unique series of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In this experiment, for half of the fields at least 50{\%} of the NDVI variance within a field was due to fertilization. Moreover, the sensitivity of NDVI to fertilizer application was crop-dependent and varied through the season, with optima at the end of August for peanut and cotton and early October for sorghum and maize. The influence of fertilizer on NDVI was comparatively small at the landscape scale (up to 35{\%} of total variation), relative to the influence of other components of variation such as field management and catena position. The NDVI response could only partially be benchmarked against a fertilization reference within the field. We conclude that comparisons of the spatial and temporal responses of NDVI, with respect to fertilization and crop management, requires a stratification of soil catena-related crop growth conditions at the landscape scale.},

The model was then integrated into the CIDS to produce two-dimensional (2-D) maps of crop growth and yield. Simulated values of rice growth and yield agreed well with the corresponding measurements in both parameterization and evaluation. The simulated yields were in statistical agreement with the corresponding measured yields according to paired t tests (p=0.415 for parameterization and p=0.939 for validation).

These studies in the last few decades have focussed on characterising and understanding vegetation phenology and its drivers especially using satellite sensor data. Nevertheless, despite being home to 17{\%} of the global forest cover, approximately 12{\%} of the world's tropical mangroves, and a diverse range of vegetation types, Africa is one of the most poorly studied regions in the world. There has been no study characterising land surface phenology (LSP) of the major land cover types in the different geographical sub-regions in Africa, and only coarse spatial resolution datasets have been used for continental studies. Therefore, we aim to provide seasonal phenological pattern of Africa's vegetation and characterise the LSP of major land cover types in different geographical sub-regions in Africa at a medium spatial resolution of 500 m using MODIS EVI time-series data over a long temporal range of 15 years (2001–2015). The Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) technique was employed to smooth the time-series data and an inflection point-based method was used to extract phenological parameters such as start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Homogeneous pixels from 12 years (2001–2012) MODIS land cover data (MODIS MCD12Q1) was used to describe, for the first time, the LSP of the major vegetation types in Africa. The results from this research characterise spatially and temporally the highly irregular and multi-annual variability of the vegetation phenology of Africa, and the maps and charts provide an improved representation of the LSP of Africa, which can serve as a pivot to filling other research gaps in the African continent.},

Integration of crop growth models with MODIS imagery at 250 m resolution from the Terra Satellite potentially offers an opportunity for operational assessment of the crop condition and yield at both field and regional scales. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of the MODIS 250 m resolution data for retrieval of crop biophysical parameters that could be integrated in crop yield simulation models. A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 m resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 m resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield simulations were conducted on a 1.6 × 1.6 km2spatial resolution grid and the results integrated to the county level.

abstract = {Remote sensing offers a low-cost method for developing spatially continuous crop production statistics across large areas and through time. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia ({\textless}2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R2 = 0.41 in 2014–2015 and R2 = 0.62 in 2015–2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R2 = 0.27 in 2014–2015 and R2 = 0.33 in 2015–2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large range in sow dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e.g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, it is likely that the methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years.},

abstract = {Satellite imagery provides a unique vantage point for observing seasonal dynamics of the landscape that have implications for global change issues. An objective evaluation of surface conditions may be performed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer data. NDVI data are typically very noisy, affected by a number of phenomena including cloud contamination, atmospheric perturbations, and variable illumination and viewing geometry, each of which usually reduces the NDVI. This work describes a weighted least-squares linear regression approach to temporal NDVI smoothing to more efficiently reduce contamination in the NDVI signal. This approach uses a moving window operating on temporal NDVI to calculate a regression line. The window is moved one period at a time, resulting in a family of regression lines associated with each point; this family of lines is then averaged at each point and interpolated between points to provide a continuous temporal NDVI signal. Also, since the factors that cause contamination usually serve to reduce NDVI values, the system applies a weighting factor that favors peak points over sloping or valley points. A final operation assures that all peak NDVI values are retained. The resulting relationship between the smoothed curve and the original data is statistically based. The smoothed data may be used to improve applications involving time-series NDVI data, such as land cover classification, seasonal vegetation characterization, and vegetation monitoring.},

Automatic multispectral and hyperspectral sensor systems were installed in parallel with an existing eddy covariance flux tower, providing spectral information of the vegetation present at high temporal resolution. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from ground-based hyperspectral and multispectral sensors were compared with NDVI products derived from Sentinel-2A and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The influence of different spatial and temporal resolutions was assessed. High correlations and similar phenological patterns between in situ and satellite-based NDVI time series demonstrated the reliability of satellite-based phenological metrics. Sentinel-2-derived metrics showed better agreement with in situ measurements than MODIS-derived metrics. Dynamic filtering with the best index slope extraction algorithm was nevertheless beneficial for Sentinel-2 NDVI time series despite the availability of quality information from the atmospheric correction procedure.},

abstract = {For the semiarid Sahelian region, climate variability is one of the most important risks of food insecurity. Field experimentations as well as crop modeling are helpful tools for the monitoring and the understanding of yields at local scale. However, extrapolation of these methods at a regional scale remains a demanding task. Remote sensing observations appear as a good alternative or addition to existing crop monitoring systems. In this study, a new approach based on the combination of vegetation and thermal indices for rainfed cereal yield assessment in the Sahelian region was investigated. Empirical statistical models were developed between MODIS NDVI and LST variables and the crop model SARRA-H simulated aboveground biomass and harvest index in order to assess each component of the yield equation. The resulting model was successfully applied at the Niamey Square Degree (NSD) site scale with yield estimations close to the official agricultural statistics of Niger for a period of 11 years (2000-2011) (r = 0.82,p-value {\textless} 0.05). The combined NDVI and LST indices-based model was found to clearly outperform the model based on NDVI alone (r = 0.59,$\backslash$ {\textless} 0.10). In areas where access to ground measurements is difficult, a simple, robust, and timely satellite-based model combining vegetation and thermal indices from MODIS and calibrated using crop model outputs can be pertinent. In particular, such a model can provide an assessment of the year-To-year yield variability shortly after harvest for regions with agronomic and climate characteristics close to those of the NSD study area.},

abstract = {Moderate resolution satellite sensors including MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) already provide more than 10 yr of observations well suited to describe and understand the dynamics of earth's surface. However, these time series are associated with significant uncertainties and incomplete because of cloud cover. This study compares eight methods designed to improve the continuity by filling gaps and consistency by smoothing the time course. It includes methods exploiting the time series as a whole (iterative caterpillar singular spectrum analysis (ICSSA), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), low pass filtering (LPF) and Whittaker smoother (Whit)) as well as methods working on limited temporal windows of a few weeks to few months (adaptive Savitzky–Golay filter (SGF), temporal smoothing and gap filling (TSGF), and asymmetric Gaussian function (AGF)), in addition to the simple climatological LAI yearly profile (Clim). Methods were applied to the MODIS leaf area index product for the period 2000–2008 and over 25 sites showed a large range of seasonal patterns. Performances were discussed with emphasis on the balance achieved by each method between accuracy and roughness depending on the fraction of missing observations and the length of the gaps. Results demonstrate that the EMD, LPF and AGF methods were failing because of a significant fraction of gaps (more than 20{\%}), while ICSSA, Whit and SGF were always providing estimates for dates with missing data. TSGF (Clim) was able to fill more than 50{\%} of the gaps for sites with more than 60{\%} (80{\%}) fraction of gaps. However, investigation of the accuracy of the reconstructed values shows that it degrades rapidly for sites with more than 20{\%} missing data, particularly for ICSSA, Whit and SGF. In these conditions, TSGF provides the best performances that are significantly better than the simple Clim for gaps shorter than about 100 days. The roughness of the reconstructed temporal profiles shows large differences between the various methods, with a decrease of the roughness with the fraction of missing data, except for ICSSA. TSGF provides the smoothest temporal profiles for sites with a {\%} gap {\textgreater} 30{\%}. Conversely, ICSSA, LPF, Whit, AGF and Clim provide smoother profiles than TSGF for sites with a {\%} gap {\textless} 30{\%}. Impact of the accuracy and smoothness of the reconstructed time series were evaluated on the timing of phenological stages. The dates of start, maximum and end of the season are estimated with an accuracy of about 10 days for the sites with a {\%} gap {\textless} 10{\%} and increases rapidly with the {\%} gap. TSGF provides more accurate estimates of phenological timing up to a {\%} gap {\textless} 60{\%}.},

abstract = {The citrus industry has the second largest impact on Florida's economy, following tourism. Estimation of citrus area coverage and annual forecasts of Florida's citrus production are currently dependent on labor-intensive interpretation of aerial photographs. Remotely sensed data from satellites has been widely applied in agricultural yield estimation and cropland management. Satellite data can potentially be obtained throughout the year, making it especially suitable for the detection of land cover change in agriculture and horticulture, plant health status, soil and moisture conditions, and effects of crop management practices. In this study, we analyzed land cover of citrus crops in Florida using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery from the University of Maryland Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF). We hypothesized that an interdisciplinary approach combining citrus production (economic) data with citrus land cover area per county would yield a correlation between observable spectral reflectance throughout the year, and the fiscal impact of citrus on local economies. While the data from official sources based on aerial photography were positively correlated, there were serious discrepancies between agriculture census data and satellite-derived cropland area using medium-resolution satellite imagery. If these discrepancies can be resolved by using imagery of higher spatial resolution, a stronger correlation would be observed for citrus production based on satellite data. This would allow us to predict the economic impact of citrus from satellite-derived spectral data analysis to determine final crop harvests. ?? 2006 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Quantitative estimates of forage availability at the end of the growing season in rangelands are helpful for pastoral livestock managers and for local, national and regional stakeholders in natural resource management. For this reason, remote sensing data such as the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) have been widely used to assess Sahelian plant productivity for about 40 years. This study combines traditional FAPAR-based assessments with agrometeorological variables computed by the geospatial water balance program, GeoWRSI, using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration satellite gridded data to estimate the annual herbaceous yield in the semi-arid areas of Senegal. It showed that a machine-learning model combining FAPAR seasonal metrics with various agrometeorological data provided better estimations of the in situ annual herbaceous yield (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 483 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) than models based exclusively on FAPAR metrics (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 550 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) or agrometeorological variables (R2 = 0.55; RMSE = 585 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha). All the models provided reasonable outputs and showed a decrease in the mean annual yield with increasing latitude, together with an increase in relative inter-annual variation. In particular, the additional use of agrometeorological information mitigated the saturation effects that characterize the plant indices of areas with high plant productivity. In addition, the date of the onset of the growing season derived from smoothed FAPAR seasonal dynamics showed no significant relationship (0.05 p-level) with the annual herbaceous yield across the whole studied area. The date of the onset of rainfall however, was significantly related to the herbaceous yield and its inclusion in fodder biomass models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of a mass herbaceous deficit at an early stage of the year.},

abstract = {Remote sensing has become a common and effective method for estimating the areal coverage of land cover classes. One class of particular interest is agriculture as area estimates of cultivated lands are important for purposes such as estimating yields or irrigation needs. The synoptic coverage of satellite imagery and the relative ease of automated analysis have led to widespread mapping of agriculture using remote sensing. The accuracy of area estimates derived from these maps is known to be related to the accuracy of the maps. However, even in the situation where the map is very accurate, errors in area estimates may occur. These errors result from the behavior of the distribution of subpixel proportions of cultivated areas, and how that behavior changes as a result of sensor spatial resolution and class definitions. The sensitivity of estimates of cultivated areas to sensor spatial resolution and to the choice of threshold used to define cultivated land is explored in six agriculturally distinct locations around the world. Using a beta model for the distribution of subpixel proportions that is parameterized using variograms, it is possible to model the distribution of subpixel proportions for any spatial resolution. When the spatial resolution is small with respect to the spatial structure of the landscape (as measured by the variogram range) use of any class definition threshold produces an estimate very close to the true area coverage. On the other hand, as the resolution becomes coarse in relation to the variogram range, the subpixel proportions are no longer concentrated at the extremes of the distribution and the difference between the estimated and the true area has greater sensitivity to the selected threshold used to define classes. Thus, for the cases examined here, both the resolution and the class definition threshold have a strong influence on area estimates. The spatial resolutions where errors can be large depend on landscape spatial structure, which can be quantified using variograms. The net effect is that for the same spatial resolution, some places will exhibit much larger errors in area estimates than others. For the site in the Anhui province of China, where agricultural fields are very small (0.07??ha on the average), area estimates are highly sensitive to class definition thresholds even at the relatively fine resolution of 45??m. Conversely, in California (USA) spatial resolutions as coarse as 500??m can be used to reliably estimate cultivated areas. Results also suggest that the proportion of the total area that is cultivated significantly influences the accuracy of area estimates. When the area proportion is low, the class definition threshold must also be low to achieve an accurate area estimate. Conversely, in areas dominated by agriculture, a very stringent class definition of cultivated lands is required for accurate area estimates. While explored in the context of estimation of cultivated areas, the findings presented here are generic to the problem of area estimation using remote sensing. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In order to ensure food security and sound, actionable mitigation strategies and policies for management of food shortages, timely and accurate estimates of global crop production are essential. This study combines a new BRDF-corrected, daily surface reflectance dataset developed from NASA's Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) with detailed official crop statistics to develop an empirical, generalized approach to forecast wheat yields. The first step of this study was to develop and evaluate a regression-based model for forecasting winter wheat production in Kansas. This regression-based model was then directly applied to forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine. The forecasts of production in Kansas closely matched the USDA/NASS reported numbers with a 7{\%} error. The same regression model forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine within 10{\%} of the official reported production numbers six weeks prior to harvest. Using new data from MODIS, this method is simple, has limited data requirements, and can provide an indication of winter wheat production shortfalls and surplus prior to harvest in regions where minimal ground data is available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {For thirty years, simple crop water balance models have been used by the early warning community to monitor agricultural drought. These models estimate and accumulate actual crop evapotranspiration, evaluating environmental conditions based on crop water requirements. Unlike seasonal rainfall totals, these models take into account the phenology of the crop, emphasizing conditions during the peak grain filling phase of crop growth. In this paper we describe an analogous metric of crop performance based on time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. A special temporal filter is used to screen for cloud contamination. Regional NDVI time series are then composited for cultivated areas, and adjusted temporally according to the timing of the rainy season. This adjustment standardizes the NDVI response vis-??-vis the expected phenological response of maize. A national time series index is then created by taking the cropped-area weighted average of the regional series. This national time series provides an effective summary of vegetation response in agricultural areas, and allows for the identification of NDVI green-up during grain filling. Onset-adjusted NDVI values following the grain filling period are well correlated with U.S. Department of Agriculture production figures, possess desirable linear characteristics, and perform better than more common indices such as maximum seasonal NDVI or seasonally averaged NDVI. Thus, just as appropriately calibrated crop water balance models can provide more information than seasonal rainfall totals, the appropriate agro-phenological filtering of NDVI can improve the utility and accuracy of space-based agricultural monitoring.},

abstract = {Fast, accurate and inexpensive estimates of crop yields at the field scale are useful for many applications. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we recently developed a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that integrates crop simulations with satellite imagery and gridded weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates for multiple crops in different regions. Existing versions of SCYM typically capture one-third to half of the variation in reported county-scale yields. Using rainfed maize in the US Midwest as an example, this study tested multiple approaches for improving SCYM's accuracy, including (i) calibrating the phenology parameters of the crop model (APSIM) used to generate training samples for SCYM; (ii) using an ensemble of three crop models (APSIM-Maize, CERES-Maize, and Hybrid-Maize) instead of a single model; (iii) using simulated biomass from the crop models instead of simulated yields to train SCYM, with the former assuming a constant harvest index (HI). Results show substantial improvement in performance, as assessed using reported county yields by USDA-NASS, both from calibrating APSIM phenology parameters and from training SCYM on simulated biomass rather than yields. Using a multi-model ensemble further improves SCYM, although the benefit is limited. The proposed preferred version of SCYM on average captures 75{\%} of the yield variation for 2001–2015 in the 3I states (i.e. Illinois, Indiana and Iowa) where SCYM is trained, with RMSE typically less than 1 t/ha, and explains 41{\%} to 83{\%} of multi-year yield variations when tested across nine Midwestern US states for 2008–2015. This level of accuracy is particularly notable given that only data from 2014 were used to calibrate phenology parameters. The yield estimates for multiple years in multiple states utilized 1184 Landsat tiles, but could be completed in about 2 h per year by using the GEE platform. All approaches tested in this study do not require any site-specific measurements, and thus can be readily extended to other regions and crops.},

However, its low spatial resolution has been an impediment to researchers pursuing more accurate classification results. In this research, the high temporal resolution of MODIS was employed to improve the accuracy of land cover classification of the North China Plain using MODIS{\_}EVI time series from 2003. Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) was performed on the MODIS{\_}EVI image time series to reduce cloud and other noise effects. The improved MODIS{\_}EVI time series was then classified into 100 clusters by the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA). To distinguish ambiguous land cover classes, a decision tree was built on five phenological features derived from EVI profiles, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and topographic slope. The overall accuracy of the final land cover map was 75.5{\%}, indicating the promise of using MODIS EVI time series and decision trees for broad area land cover classification. ?? 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {The goal of this study is to evaluate the relative usefulness of high spectral and temporal resolutions of MODIS imagery data for land cover classification. In particular, we highlight the individual and combinatorial influence of spectral and temporal components of MODIS reflectance data in land cover classification. Our study relies on an annual time series of twelve MODIS 8-days composited images (MOD09A1) monthly acquired during the year 2000, at a 500 m nominal resolution. As our aim is not to propose an operational classifier directed at thematic mapping based on the most efficient combination of reflectance inputs - which will probably change across geographical regions and with different land cover nomenclatures - we intentionally restrict our experimental framework to continental Portugal. Because our observation data stream contains highly correlated components, we need to rank the temporal and the spectral features according not only to their individual ability at separating the land cover classes, but also to their differential contribution to the existing information. To proceed, we resort to the median Mahalanobis distance as a statistical separability criterion. Once achieved this arrangement, we strive to evaluate, in a classification perspective, the gain obtained when the dimensionality of the input feature space grows. We then successively embedded the prior ranked measures into the multitemporal and multispectral training data set of a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. In this way, we show that, only the inclusion of the approximately first three dates substantially increases the classification accuracy. Moreover, this multitemporal factor has a significant effect when coupled with combinations of few spectral bands, but it turns negligible as soon as the full spectral information is exploited. Regarding the multispectral factor, its beneficence on classification accuracy remains more constant, regardless of the number of dates being used. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Wardlow and others use See 5.0 decision tree classification with boosting to classify multitemporal MODIS 250 m NDVI imagery over Kansas. This is only one of a four-tier hierarchical classification scheme, utilizing various techniques. The four tiers are crop/no-crop, general crop (alfalfa, winter wheat, and summer crops), summer crops (corn, soybean, sorghum) and irrigated/non-irrigated. They cite some previous work done on this subject with TM but they are only a MS thesis and a Transactions from the Kansas Academy of Sciences paper. They use a somewhat confusing array of validation datasets, including total areal coverage of specific crops at the state and ASD (agricultural statistics district)-level conducted by the USDA NASS, 2179 field sites that were classified from aerial photos, some Landsat TM images from 2001, and data from the Kansas GAP (Gap Analysis Program) LULC map constructed from early 1990's TM images (yes, a little old).  The first tier, crop/no-crop was made with isodata unsupervised classification. These data were validated against the GAP data-based only on areal extent as well field test sites (but I am rather confused by how each accuracy assessment was derived). For the latter, there were producer's and user's accuracies of 87{\%} and 96.5{\%}. Compared with ASD-level areal extents, there was a very high coefficient of determination (r=0.98). The second tier, general crop mapping, classified the maps into alfalfa, winter wheat, summer crops, and fallow using the decision tree (it was applied to all successive tiers as well). Using See 5.0, they ran 10 boosting iterations on an NDVI time series of 15 dates, from March 22 to November 1. Accuracies for the second tier were very high, with {\textgreater}97{\%} accuracies for each class. They admit, though, accuracies may have been inflated by careful selection of their validation data (choosing only pixels from the center of a field as opposed to a pixel-window). Most of their error came from the fallow designation. At the third tier, summer crops were classified with generally greater than 80{\%} accuracies. Comparing these results with area-based NASS, they had {\~{}}.9 =r for corn and sorghum but low accuracy for soybean (r=0.42). This is due to propagation of a misclassifications at the first tier, indicating that soybean was often misconstrued as non-crop. For the last tier, they used data from a very good rain year (2001), where there wasabnormal production in non-irrigated plots and temporal activity between both classes were relatively similar as well. Nonetheless, primarily using NDVI magnitude as a basis for differentiation, they two classes were classified with at least 80{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the accuracy of an object-oriented classification of polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to map and monitor crops using 19 RADARSAT-2 fine beam polarimetric (FQ) images of an agricultural area in North-eastern Ontario, Canada. Polarimetric images and field data were acquired during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. The classification and field data collection focused on the main crop types grown in the region, which include: wheat, oat, soybean, canola and forage. The polarimetric parameters were extracted with PolSAR analysis using both the Cloude-Pottier and Freeman-Durden decompositions. The object-oriented classification, with a single date of PolSAR data, was able to classify all five crop types with an accuracy of 95{\%} and Kappa of 0.93; a 6{\%} improvement in comparison with linear-polarization only classification. However, the time of acquisition is crucial. The larger biomass crops of canola and soybean were most accurately mapped, whereas the identification of oat and wheat were more variable. The multi-temporal data using the Cloude-Pottier decomposition parameters provided the best classification accuracy compared to the linear polarizations and the Freeman-Durden decomposition parameters. In general, the object-oriented classifications were able to accurately map crop types by reducing the noise inherent in the SAR data. Furthermore, using the crop classification maps we were able to monitor crop growth stage based on a trend analysis of the radar response. Based on field data from canola crops, there was a strong relationship between the phenological growth stage based on the BBCH scale, and the HV backscatter and entropy. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Crop yield forecast models for barley, canola and spring wheat grown on the Canadian Prairies were developed using vegetation indices derived from satellite data and machine learning methods. Hierarchical clustering was used to group the crop yield data from 40 Census Agricultural Regions (CARs) into several larger regions for building the forecast models. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and NDVI derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were considered as predictors for crop yields. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and two nonlinear machine learning models - Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB) - were used to forecast crop yields, with various combinations of MODIS-NDVI, MODIS-EVI and NOAA-NDVI as predictors. Crop yield forecasts made using predictors from July and earlier were evaluated by the cross-validated mean absolute error skill score (in reference to climatological forecasts) during 2000-2011. While MODIS-NDVI was found to be the most effective predictor for all three crops, having MODIS-EVI as an additional predictor enhanced the forecast skills. While MLR, BNN and MOB all showed significantly higher skills than climatological forecasts for all three crops, barley was the only case where the nonlinear BNN and MOB models showed slightly higher skills than MLR. The lack of skill improvement by nonlinear models over MLR is likely due to the short (12 years) record available for MODIS data, which limits our study to 2000-2011, with very low yields coming from a single severe drought year (2002).},

As an advantage to traditional methods, the approach does not rely on thermal bands and it is applicable to images from most high resolution earth observation remote sensing sensors. The methodology couples pixel-based seed identification and object-based region growing. The seed identification stage relies on pixel value comparison between high resolution images and cloud free composites at lower spatial resolution from almost simultaneously acquired dates. The methodology was tested taking SPOT4-HRVIR, SPOT5-HRG and IRS-LISS III as high resolution images and cloud free MODIS composites as reference images. The selected scenes included a wide range of cloud types and surface features. The resulting cloud masks were evaluated through visual comparison. They were also compared with ad-hoc independently generated cloud masks and with the automatic cloud cover assessment algorithm (ACCA). In general the results showed an agreement in detected clouds higher than 95{\%} for clouds larger than 50. ha. The approach produced consistent results identifying and mapping clouds of different type and size over various land surfaces including natural vegetation, agriculture land, built-up areas, water bodies and snow. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Crop phonology monitoring is an important part of growth monitoring. On the other hand, the analysis on crop phenology can improve the accuracy of crop classification and crop yield estimation. Crop phenology mainly has relation not only to weather variety, but also to the regional planting habit. Crop phonological stages and growth period vary in different areas and different years. With the development of remote sensing technique, the detection of crop phenology and it s mechanism using remote sensing data on regional or global scales have become popular topics in remote sensing applications. The MERIS data can provide time-serial terrestrial parameters at a several-day frequency, with which we can track the growing process of crops (take winter wheat for example) and study its variation in the growing season. The normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) derived from red band and near infrared band of MERIS sensor is a directly remote sensing indicator that reflects crop growth situation. However, due to reasons such as the influence of cloud and atmospheric conditions, the residual noise in the time-series NDVI derived from MERIS will induce erroneous result in crop phenology monitoring. Thus in this study, after the time-series NDVI was computed from MERIS data, a Savitzky-Golay filter was used to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series at pixel scale, and a time-series NDVI dataset at day frequency was produced (reconstructed). Then indicators such as the peak were extracted from the crop NDVI profile for each pixel. After that the relation between these indicators and different phonological stages for winter wheat was analyzed and a model to estimate certain phonological stage for winter wheat was developed from the analysis. The model was validated with the field observation data collected from Fengqiu, Henan province and Yucheng, Shandong province.

abstract = {Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (≥250m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (≤30m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.},

abstract = {PhenoSat is an experimental software tool that produces phenological information from satellite vegetation index time series. The main characteristics and functionalities of the PhenoSat tool are presented, and its performance is compared against observed measures and other available software applications. A multiyear experiment was carried out for different vegetation types: vineyard, low shrublands, and seminatural meadows. Temporal satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data provided by MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION were used to test the ability of the software in extracting vegetation dynamics information. Three important PhenoSat features were analyzed: extraction of the main growing season information, estimation of double growth season parameters, and the advantage of selecting a temporal region of interest. Seven noise reduction filters were applied: cubic smoothing splines, polynomial curve fitting, Fourier series, Gaussian models, piecewise logistic, Savitzky-Golay (SG), and a combination of the last two. The results showed that PhenoSat is a useful tool to extract NDVI metrics related to vegetation dynamics, obtaining high significant correlations between observed and estimated parameters for most of the phenological stages and vegetation types studied. Using the combination of SG and piecewise logistic to fit the NDVI time series, PhenoSat obtained correlations higher than 0.71, except for the seminatural meadow start of season. The selection of a temporal region of interest improved the fitting process, consequently providing more reliable phenological information. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of − 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2–4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1–3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground-based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8–10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2–3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1–2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1–3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.},

Presently, the most common method for the estimation of sowing dates in West African countries consists of applying given thresholds on rainfall estimations. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the possible inaccuracy of these estimations are limiting factors. In this context, the remote sensing approach, which consists of deriving green-up onset dates from satellite remote sensing data, appears as an interesting alternative. It builds upon a novel statistic model that translates vegetation onset detections derived from MODIS time series into sowing probabilities at the village level. Results for Niger show that this approach outperforms the standard method adopted in the region based on rainfall thresholds.},

We proposed an approach to accurately extract representative NDVI temporal profiles for the 12 land cover cluster types by clustering profiles, selecting optimal number of clusters, merging and labeling clusters, and selecting the representative NDVI profiles. The geometric average of the mean average distance between the reconstructed profile and the raw profiles, and the mean average distance between the reconstructed profile and the upper envelope (Dg(nr,. c)) was selected as the most appropriate measure substitutive to RMSE for the evaluation of the noise reduction effects, when the 'true' profiles were not available. The running median, mean value, maximum operation, end point processing, and Hanning smoothing (RMMEH) filter and iterative Savitzky-Golay filter were the two most appropriate noise reduction techniques for the NDVI temporal profiles of the study area in the evaluation of noise reduction effects by the seven techniques. The robust framework using the proposed approach for the accurate extraction of representative NDVI temporal profiles and (Dg(nr,. c)) in this study, is applicable in the evaluation of noise reduction effects using different techniques and in other study areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Fortunately, the new generation of satellite in a form of constellation, e.g. Europe's Sentinel-2, China's HJ-1A/B and GF-1/6, is expected to provide more frequent observations ({\textless}1 week) with a higher spatial resolution ({\textless}30 m). Consequently, a proper method should be selected to construct high spatio-temporal time-series NDVI and to derive phenological features for urban applications. In this study, a high spatio-temporal NDVI product for urban scale vegetation time series is conducted based on HJ-1A/B data. Three related issues, i.e. the optimal filter, time series decomposition, phenological features derivation are addressed. In addition, the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the phenological features extraction is also discussed according to the comparison between the derived NDVI product and that extracted from MODIS. The results show that the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is the best filter for the reconstruction of HJ NDVI time series. There is some difference for phenology derivation using “season” and “season + trend” depending on the absence/presence of breakpoints in the curve. The spatial details of phenological features can be built by the high-spatial time-series NDVI, showing a great potential in urban applications. Compared with the MODIS NDVI time series, HJ NDVI time series can get more detail information than overall phenological features because of its high spatio-temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop production in the food insecure regions of West Africa. The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.},

This paper seeks to bridge the gap between researchers and practitioners, first, by illustrating where research tools and techniques have practical applications and, second, by identifying real problems that remote sensing could solve, albeit with additional research and development. As freshwater becomes an increasingly scarce resource, all opportunities to better manage water uses, particularly in irrigated agriculture, must be taken.

abstract = {This paper deals with the monitoring of water status and the assessment of the effect of stress on citrus fruit quality using structural and physiological remote sensing indices. Four flights were conducted over a citrus orchard in 2009 using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a multispectral camera with six narrow spectral bands in the visible and near infrared. Physiological indices such as the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI 570), a new structurally robust PRI formulation that uses the 515nm as the reference band (PRI 515), and a chlorophyll ratio (R 700/R 670) were compared against the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) and Modified Triangular Vegetation Index (MTVI) canopy structural indices for their performance in tracking water status and the effects of sustained water stress on fruit quality at harvest. The irrigation setup in the commercial orchard was compared against a treatment scheduled to satisfy full requirements (based on estimated crop evapotranspiration) using two regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies. The water status of the trees throughout the experiment was monitored with frequent field measurements of stem water potential ($\Psi$ x), while titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids (TSS) were measured at harvest on selected trees from each irrigation treatment. The high spatial resolution of the multispectral imagery (30cm pixel size) enabled identification of pure tree crown components, extracting the tree reflectance from shaded, sunlit and aggregated pixels. The physiological and structural indices were then calculated from each tree at the following levels: (i) pure sunlit tree crown, (ii) entire crown, aggregating the within-crown shadows, and (iii) simulating a lower resolution pixel, including tree crown, sunlit and shaded soil pixels. The resulting analysis demonstrated that both PRI formulations were able to track water status, except when water stress altered canopy structure. In such cases, PRI 570 was more affected than PRI 515 by the structural changes caused by sustained water stress throughout the season. Both PRI formulations were proven to serve as pre-visual water stress indicators linked to fruit quality TSS and TA parameters (r 2=0.69 for PRI 515 vs TSS; r 2=0.58 vs TA). In contrast, the chlorophyll (R 700/R 670) and structural indices (NDVI, RDVI, MTVI) showed poor relationships with fruit quality and water status levels (r 2=0.04 for NDVI vs TSS; r 2=0.19 vs TA). The two PRI formulations showed strong relationships with the field-measured fruit quality parameters in September, the beginning of stage III, which appeared to be the period most sensitive to water stress and the most critical for assessing fruit quality in citrus. Both PRI 515 and PRI 570 showed similar performance for the two scales assessed (sunlit crown and entire crown), demonstrating that within-crown component separation is not needed in citrus tree crowns where the shaded vegetation component is small. However, the simulation conducted through spatial resampling on tree+soil aggregated pixels revealed that the physiological indices were highly affected by soil reflectance and between-tree shadows, showing that for TSS vs PRI 515 the relationship dropped from r 2=0.69 to r 2=0.38 when aggregating soil+crown components. This work confirms a previous study that demonstrated the link between PRI 570, water stress, and fruit quality, while also making progress in assessing the new PRI formulation (PRI 515), the within-crown shadow effects on the physiological indices, and the need for high resolution imagery to target individual tree crowns for the purpose of evaluating the effects of water stress on fruit quality in citrus. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) was established to maintain balance between farming industries and the environment as well as to provide economic sustainability in rural areas. EU Regulations for agricultural and rural development, adopted by countries upon their admission to the EU, allow payments to farmers for each eligible hectare of agricultural land (CAP reform), under different payment schemes. Remote sensing data is currently used as an efﬁcient tool in determining areas potentially eligible for payments, through land cover identiﬁcation and mapping. Launched in August 2008, RapidEye consists of ﬁve constellation multispectral sensors with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 6.5m and a daily overpass. The satellite has a predicted lifespan of 7 years and with the target application of the sensor being agriculture; contains a high potential for the application of agricultural monitoring, necessary to some new Member States, such as Bulgaria and Romania. Analysis of RapidEye imagery, combined with local ancillary data over pre-selected test zones lead to determination and classiﬁcation of land cover features which have potential or no potential to be eligible under the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS). This classiﬁcation was completed using object oriented analysis and was run concurrently alongside a pixel based (self-organizing maps) analysis for comparison.},

abstract = {Time series of images are required to extract and separate information on vegetation change due to phenological cycles, inter-annual climatic variability, and long-term trends. While images from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor have the spatial and spectral characteristics suited for mapping a range of vegetation structural and compositional properties, its 16-day revisit period combined with cloud cover problems and seasonally limited latitudinal range, limit the availability of images at intervals and durations suitable for time series analysis of vegetation in many parts of the world. Landsat Image Time Series (LITS) is defined here as a sequence of Landsat TM images with observations from every 16 days for a five-year period, commencing on July 2003, for a Eucalyptus woodland area in Queensland, Australia. Synthetic Landsat TM images were created using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm for all dates when images were either unavailable or too cloudy. This was done using cloud-free scenes and a MODIS Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) product. The ability of the LITS to measure attributes of vegetation phenology was examined by: (1) assessing the accuracy of predicted image-derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) estimates using ground-measured values; and (2) comparing the LITS-generated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1) time series. The predicted image-derived FPC products (value ranges from 0 to 100{\%}) had an RMSE of 5.6. Comparison between vegetation phenology parameters estimated from LITS-generated NDVI and MODIS NDVI showed no significant difference in trend and less than 16 days (equal to the composite period of the MODIS data used) difference in key seasonal parameters, including start and end of season in most of the cases. In comparison to similar published work, this paper tested the STARFM algorithm in a new (broadleaf) forest environment and also demonstrated that the approach can be used to form a time series of Landsat TM images to study vegetation phenology over a number of years.},

abstract = {The future trajectory of crop yields in the United States will influence food supply and land use worldwide. We examine maize and soybean yields for 2000–2015 in the Midwestern U.S. using a new satellite-based dataset on crop yields at 30m resolution. We quantify heterogeneity both within and between fields, and find that the difference between average and top yielding fields is typically below 30{\%} for both maize and soybean, as expected in advanced agricultural regions. In most counties, within-field heterogeneity is at least half as large as overall heterogeneity, illustrating the importance of non-management factors such as soil and landscape position. Surprisingly, we find that yield heterogeneity is rising in maize, both between and within fields, with average yield differences between the best and worst soils more than doubling since 2000. Heterogeneity trends were insignificant for soybean. The findings are consistent both with recent adoption of precision agriculture technologies and with recent trends toward denser sowing in maize, which disproportionately raise yields on better soils. The results imply that yield gains in the region are increasingly derived from the more productive land, and that sub-field precision management of nutrients and other inputs is increasingly warranted.},

abstract = {In recent years, the use of high temporal resolution satellite data has been emerging as an important tool to study crop phenology. Most methods to detect phenological events based on satellite data use thresholds to identify key events in the lifecycle of the crop. In this study, a new method was used to define such thresholds for identifying the start and end of the growing season (SOS/EOS) for 43 different agricultural zones in China. The method used 2000–2003 NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data with a spatial resolution of eight kilometers and a temporal resolution of 15 days. Following data pre-processing, time series for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI or N), slope of the NDVI curve (S), and difference (D) between the NDVI value and a base NDVI value for bare land without snow were constructed. For each zone, an optimal set of threshold values for N, D, and S was determined, based on the remote sensing data and observed SOS/EOS data for 2003 at 261 agro-meteorological stations. Results were verified by comparing the accuracy of the new proposed NDS threshold method with the results of three other methods for SOS/EOS detection with remote sensing data. The findings of all four methods were compared to  in situ SOS/EOS data from 2000 to 2002 for 110 agro-meteorological stations. Results show that the developed NDS threshold method had a significantly higher accuracy compared with other methods. The method is mainly limited by the observed data and the necessity of reestablishing the thresholds periodically.},

abstract = {Low resolution satellite imagery has been extensively used for crop monitoring and yield forecasting for over 30 years and plays an important role in a growing number of operational systems. The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today.},

abstract = {This study aims at developing a robust and generic methodology, based on the use of high resolution remote sensing data to provide accurate estimates of maize biomass and yield over large areas (i.e. at regional scale). We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R = 0.98; RRMSE = 14{\%}) and yield (R = 0.81; RRMSE = 8.9{\%}), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R = 0.96; RRMSE = 4.6{\%}). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.},

@article{Azzari2017,
abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in monitoring food security is to provide reliable crop yield information that is temporally consistent and spatially scalable. An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and subfield level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000 km2), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000 km2), and wheat in northern India (450,000 km2). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat's sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R2≥ 0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R2{\textgreater} 0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30 m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.},

abstract = {Within the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS; Royer and Genovese, 2004) of the European Commission vegetation indicators like NDVI, SAVI and fAPAR are operationally derived for daily, decadal and monthly time steps. Besides low resolution sensors as SPOT-VGT and NOAA-AVHRR, medium resolution data from TERRA/AQUA-MODIS or ENVISAT-MERIS are used at pan-European level. In case of available time series, esp. NOAA-AVHRR (since 1981) and SPOT-VGT (since 1998) difference values of the indicators (e.g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e.g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The exploitation of the data is performed at full resolution, at grid level of the MCYFS or regional unmixed means (C-indicators) are used. Therefore a database has been set-up in order to provide the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The current work aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects. Therefore, existing methods as simple sliding windows, piecewise linear regression or fitting of polynomial functions are employed and compared. Thereafter, the time series analysis is performed with the aim to establish relationships between indicators profile features and the crop phenology},

abstract = {Current remote sensing studies of phenology have been limited to coarse spatial or temporal resolution and often lack a direct link to field measurements. To address this gap, we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive field measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices, five mathematical fits to model a continuous temporal response, and a suite of threshold estimates for "start of spring/season" (SOS) assessments were compared to field measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency, leaf area index, greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least five spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to field metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11. days for all species and elevation combinations, but improved to 9. days for hardwood dominated plots and 7. days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8. days when forest type (mixed, conifer hardwood) was used to refine predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low, inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology over time. This was confirmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12. days of mean absolute error. However, image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.},

abstract = {Forest cover plays a key role in climate change by influencing the carbon stocks, the hydrological cycle andthe energy balance. Forest cover information can be determined from fine-resolution data, such as LandsatEnhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). However, forest cover classification with fine-resolution datausually uses only one temporal data because successive data acquirement is difficult. It may achievemis-classification result without involving vegetation growth information, because different vegetationtypes may have the similar spectral features in the fine-resolution data. To overcome these issues, a forestcover classification method using Landsat ETM+ data appending with time series Moderate-resolutionImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data was proposed.The objective was to investigate the potential of temporal features extracted from coarse-resolution timeseries vegetation index data on improving the forest cover classification accuracy using fine-resolutionremote sensing data. This method firstly fused Landsat ETM+ NDVI and MODIS NDVI data to obtain timeseries fine-resolution NDVI data, and then the temporal features were extracted from the fused NDVIdata. Finally, temporal features combined with Landsat ETM+ spectral data was used to improve forestcover classification accuracy using supervised classifier. The study in North China region confirmed thattime series NDVI features had significant effects on improving forest cover classification accuracy of fineresolution remote sensing data. The NDVI features extracted from time series fused NDVI data couldimprove the overall classification accuracy approximately 5{\%} from 88.99{\%} to 93.88{\%} compared to onlyusing single Landsat ETM+ data. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For remote sensing to be useful for analyzing crop yield gaps, methods should be accurate at the field scale without need for local ground calibration. We used an extensive field-level data set of on-farm yields from 134 irrigated and 94 rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Nebraska during a 4-yr period to evaluate three methods that do not require ground-based calibration. The first method is based on summing estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, the second on using either MODIS or Landsat data to calibrate a crop model (Hybrid-Maize), and the third using Hybrid-Maize simulations to train a simple regression, which is then applied to MODIS or Landsat data. For MODIS, all three methods performed similarly poorly at predicting maize yields, with an R-2 between observed and predicted yields of roughly 0.10 for rainfed and 0.20 for irrigated fields. Estimates from Landsat were considerably more accurate, with up to 20{\%} of rainfed and 50{\%} of irrigated yield variation captured by the predictions. Across all methods and sensors, irrigated yield variations were more successfully captured than rainfed yields because of relatively smaller rainfed field sizes and the added difficulty of modeling crop water stress in rainfed fields. Agreement between observed and predicted yields was highest for the third approach, which is attractive because it leverages a crop model's ability to synthesize knowledge on crop physiology and year-to-year differences in weather throughout the season, yet produces a simple regression that can be rapidly applied to Landsat imagery.},

abstract = {We used data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in association with county-level data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop empirical models predicting maize and soybean yield in the Central United States. As part of our analysis we also tested the ability of MODIS to capture inter-annual variability in yields. Our results show that the MODIS two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) provides a better basis for predicting maize yields relative to the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Inclusion of information related to crop phenology derived from MODIS significantly improved model performance within and across years. Surprisingly, using moderate spatial resolution data from the MODIS Land Cover Type product to identify agricultural areas did not degrade model results relative to using higher-spatial resolution crop-type maps developed by the USDA. Correlations between vegetation indices and yield were highest 65-75 days after greenup for maize and 80 days after greenup for soybeans. EVI2 was the best index for predicting maize yield in non-semi-arid counties (R2=0.67), but the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed better in semi-arid counties (R2=0.69), probably because the NDWI is sensitive to irrigation in semi-arid areas with low-density agriculture. NDVI and EVI2 performed equally well predicting soybean yield (R2=0.69 and 0.70, respectively). In addition, EVI2 was best able to capture large negative anomalies in maize yield in 2005 (R2=0.73). Overall, our results show that using crop phenology and a combination of EVI2 and NDWI have significant benefit for remote sensing-based maize and soybean yield models. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Regional phenology is important in ecosystem simulation models and coupled biosphere/atmosphere models. In the continental United States, the timing of the onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-off) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and climatological data. Predictions were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km x 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7.2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6.1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5.3 days in the DBF biome and 6.3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95{\%} probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lilac phenology. Continental application of the phenology models for 1990-1992 revealed extensive interannual variability in onset and offset. Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of 129 days in 1991 to a high of 146 days in 1992. Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.},

In this paper, we compared the phenology of rangeland vs cropped land in the Sahel belt of Africa, using the only currently available global phenology product (MODIS MCD12Q2 - Land Cover Dynamics Yearly), and an enhanced crop mask of Mali. The differences in terms of start-of-season (SOS) are spatially (north south gradient), and temporally (10 years, 2001-2009) analyzed in bioclimatic terms. Our results show that globally the MODIS MCD12Q2 SOS dates of croplands and rangelands differ, and that these differences depend on the bioclimatic zone. In Sahelian and Guinean regions, cropland vegetation begins to grow earlier than rangeland vegetation (8-day and 4-day advance, respectively). Between, in the Sudanian and Sudano-Sahelian parts of Mali, rangeland vegetation greens about one week earlier than croplands. These results are discussed in the context of the land surface heterogeneity at MODIS scale, and in the context of the natural vegetation ecology.

abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP) provides bio-indication of ongoing climate change. It uses space-borne greenness proxies to monitor plant phenology at the landscape level from the regional to global scale. However, several unconsidered methodological and observational -related limitations may lead to misinterpretation of the satellite-derived signals. For instance, changes in species composition within a pixel could result in a change in the time series of the greenness proxy, due to the distinct phenology of the plant species involved. The change in the signal would then be misinterpreted as a phenological change while it is actually related to changes in species composition within the pixel. Other limitations include the selection of the smoothing technique and the method used to extract the LSP metrics. These not only may affect the timing of the LSP metrics but also the sign of the observed LSP change. Another and much less known limitation is related to the mixed signal from multi-canopy layers. Satellites may detect changes that corresponds to the understorey layer in complex vertical vegetation systems while the ‘real' contribution of this layer (in terms of ecosystem functioning and dynamics) might be small compared to the undetected overstorey layer in cases of a late overstorey development. Here, some of the LSP basics are reviewed with emphasis on these (and other) potential sources of misinterpretation. Several aids to overcome these limitations, which include suggestions for multi methods analysis and the integration of information from satellite and ground-based sensors are provided alongside some prospective future LSP research directions.},

abstract = {Agricultural production capacity contributes to food security in Afghanistan and is largely dependent on irrigated farming, mostly utilizing surface water fed by snowmelt. Because of the high contribution of irrigated crops ({\textgreater}80{\%}) to total agricultural production, knowing the spatial distribution and year-to-year variability in irrigated areas is imperative to monitoring food security for the country. We used 16-day composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor to create 23-point time series for each year from 2000 through 2013. Seasonal peak values and time series were used in a threshold-dependent decision tree algorithm to map irrigated areas in Afghanistan for the last 14years. In the absence of ground reference irrigated area information, we evaluated these maps with the irrigated areas classified from multiple snapshots of the landscape during the growing season from Landsat 5 optical and thermal sensor images. We were able to identify irrigated areas using Landsat imagery by selecting as irrigated those areas with Landsat-derived NDVI greater than 0.30–0.45, depending on the date of the Landsat image and surface temperature less than or equal to 310 Kelvin (36.9° C). Due to the availability of Landsat images, we were able to compare with the MODIS-derived maps for four years: 2000, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The irrigated areas derived from Landsat agreed well r2=0.91 with the irrigated areas derived from MODIS, providing confidence in the MODIS NDVI threshold approach. The maps portrayed a highly dynamic irrigated agriculture practice in Afghanistan, where the amount of irrigated area was largely determined by the availability of surface water, especially snowmelt, and varied by as much as 30{\%} between water surplus and water deficit years. During the past 14years, 2001, 2004, and 2008 showed the lowest levels of irrigated area ({\~{}}1.5 million hectares), attesting to the severe drought conditions in those years, whereas 2009, 2012 and 2013 registered the largest irrigated area ({\~{}}2.5 million hectares) due to record snowpack and snowmelt in the region. The model holds promise the ability to provide near-real-time (by the end of the growing seasons) estimates of irrigated area, which are beneficial for food security monitoring as well as subsequent decision making for the country. While the model is developed for Afghanistan, it can be adopted with appropriate adjustments in the derived threshold values to map irrigated areas elsewhere.},

In this regard, support vector machines (SVMs) have recently received increasing attention. However, small number of training samples remains a bottleneck to design suitable supervised classifiers. On the other hand, adequate number of unlabeled data is available in remote sensing images which can be employed as additional source of information about margins. To fully leverage all of the precious unlabeled data, integration of filtering in a transductive SVM is proposed.Using two labeled image datasets of small size and two large unlabeled image datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is explored. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves average overall accuracies of around 4.5-7.8{\%}, 0.8-2.6{\%} and 0.9-2.2{\%} more than the standard inductive SVM (ISVM), progressive transductive SVM (PTSVM) and low density separation (LDS) classifiers, respectively on larger domains in case of labeled datasets.

Numerical decision rules based on fuzzy logic that coupled knowledge of ecology and the information content of single and multi-date remotely sensed data and derived products (e.g., vegetation indices) were developed to discriminate vegetation types based primarily on inferred differences in phenology, structure, wetness and productivity. Results: The rule-based classification gave a good representation of the distribution of habitats and agricultural land. The more extensive, contiguous and homogeneous habitats could be mapped with accuracies exceeding 80{\%}, although accuracies were lower for more complex environments (e.g., upland mosaics) or those with broad definition (e.g., semi-improved grasslands). Main conclusions: The application of a rule-based classification to temporal imagery acquired over selected periods within an annual cycle provides a viable approach for mapping and monitoring of habitats and agricultural land in the United Kingdom that could be employed operationally. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Many terrestrial biomes are experiencing intensifying human land use. However, reductions in the intensity of agricultural land use are also common and can lead to agricultural land abandonment. Agricultural land abandonment has strong environmental and socio-economic consequences, but fine-scale and spatially explicit data on agricultural land abandonment are sparse, particularly in developing countries and countries with transition economies, such as the post-Soviet countries of Eastern Europe. Remote sensing can potentially fill this gap, but the satellite-based detection of fallow fields and shrub encroachment is difficult and requires the collection of multiple images during the growing season. The availability of such multi-seasonal cloud-free image dates is often limited. The goal of our study was to determine how much "missing" Landsat TM/ETM. + images at key times in the growing season affect the accuracy of agricultural land abandonment classification. We selected a study area in temperate Eastern Europe where post-socialist agricultural land abandonment had become widespread and analyzed six near-anniversary cloud-free Landsat images from "Spring", "Summer" and "Fall" agriculturally defined seasons for a pre-abandonment-time I (1989) and post-abandonment-time II (1999/2000). Using a factorial experiment, we tested how the classification accuracy and spatial patterns of classified abandonment changed over all possible 49 image-date combinations when mapping both "abandoned arable land" and "abandoned managed grassland". The conditional Kappa of our best overall classification with support vector machines (SVM) was 90{\%} for "abandoned arable land" and 72{\%} for "abandoned managed grassland" when all six images were used for the classification. Classifications with fewer image dates resulted in a substantial decrease of the conditional Kappa (from 93 to 54{\%} for "abandoned arable land" and from to 75 to 50{\%} for "abandoned managed grassland"). We also observed substantial decrease in accurate detection of land abandonment patterns when we compared our best overall classification with the other 48 image date combinations (the Fuzzy Kappa, a measure of spatial similarity, ranged from 25.8 to 76.3{\%} for "abandoned arable land" and from 30.4 to 79.5{\%} for "abandoned managed grassland"). While the accuracy of the different abandonment classes was most sensitive to the number of image dates used for the classification, the seasons captured also mattered, and the importance of specific seasonal image dates varied between the pre- and post-abandonment dates. For "abandoned arable land" it was important to have at least one "Spring" or "Summer" image for pre-abandonment and as many images as possible for post-abandonment, with a "Spring" image again being most important. For "abandoned managed grassland" no specific seasonal image dates yielded statistically significantly more accurate classifications. The factor that influenced the accurate detection of "abandoned managed grassland" was the number of multi-seasonal image dates (the more the better), rather than their exact dates. We also tested whether SVM performed better than the maximum likelihood classifier. SVM outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier only for "abandoned arable land" and only in image-date-rich cases. Our results showed that limited image-date availability in the Landsat record placed substantial limits on the accuracy of agricultural abandonment classifications and accurately detected agricultural land abandonment patterns. Thus, we warn to use agricultural land abandonment maps produced with the sub-optimal image dates with caution, especially when the accurate rates and the patterns of agricultural land abandonment are crucial (e.g., for LULCC models). The abundance of agricultural abandonment in many parts of the world and its strong ecological and socio-economic consequences suggest that better monitoring of abandonment is necessary, and our results illustrated the image dates that were most important to accomplishing this task. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the "Shape-Model Fitting Method". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10. days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10{\%} especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The use of hyperspectral data to map rock types on a vertical mine face is demonstrated, with a view to providing real-time information for automated mining applications. The performance of two classification techniques, namely, spectral angle mapper (SAM) and support vector machines (SVMs), is compared rigorously using a spectral library acquired under various conditions of illumination. SAM and SVM are then applied to a mine face, and results are compared with geological boundaries mapped in the field. Effects of changing conditions of illumination, including shadow, were investigated by applying SAM and SVM to imagery acquired at different times of the day. As expected, classification of the spectral libraries showed that, on average, SVM gave superior results for SAM, although SAM performed better where spectra were acquired under conditions of shadow. In contrast, when applied to hypserspectral imagery of a mine face, SVM did not perform as well as SAM. Shadow, through its impact upon spectral curve shape and albedo, had a profound impact on classification using SAM and SVM.},

abstract = {Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (≥250m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (≤30m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.},

abstract = {The phenology of vegetation exerts an important control over the terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) cycle. Remote sensing of key phenological phases in forests (e.g., the spring onset and autumn end of growing season) remains challenging due to noise in time series and the limited seasonal variation of canopy greenness in evergreen forests. Using 94 site-years of C flux data from four deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) and six evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) in North America, we examine whether growing season phenology can be remotely sensed from mean vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spring (Apr.-May) and autumn (Sep.-Nov) observations. Five VIs were used based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the land surface water index (LSWI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). Our results show that growing season transitions can be inferred from mean seasonal VIs, though the different VIs varied in their predictive strength across sites and plant functional types. Widely used NDVI and EVI exhibited limited potential in tracking growing season phenology of ENF ecosystems, while indices sensitive to water (i.e., LSWI) or less influenced by soil (i.e., OSAVI) may have unrevealed powers in indicating phenological transitions. OSAVI was shown to be a strong predictor of the end of the growing season in ENF ecosystems, suggesting that this VI may offer a new strategy for modeling the phenology of ENF sites. We conclude that combinations of multiple indices may improve the remote sensing of land surface phenology, as evidenced by the good agreement between modeled and observed growing season transitions and its length in our evaluation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of crop production in smallholder farming systems are critical to the understanding of yield constraints and, thus, setting the appropriate agronomic investments and policies for improving food security and reducing poverty. Nevertheless, mapping the yields of smallholder farms is challenging because of factors such as small field sizes and heterogeneous landscapes. Recent advances in fine-resolution satellite sensors offer promise for monitoring and characterizing the production of smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the utility of different sensors, including the commercial Skysat and RapidEye satellites and the publicly accessible Sentinel-2, for tracking smallholder maize yield variation throughout a {\~{}}40,000 km2 western Kenya region. We tested the potential of two types of multiple regression models for predicting yield: (i) a “calibrated model”, which required ground-measured yield and weather data for calibration, and (ii) an “uncalibrated model”, which used a process-based crop model to generate daily vegetation index and end-of-season biomass and/or yield as pseudo training samples. Model performance was evaluated at the field, division, and district scales using a combination of farmer surveys and crop cuts across thousands of smallholder plots in western Kenya. Results show that the “calibrated” approach captured a significant fraction (R2 between 0.3 and 0.6) of yield variations at aggregated administrative units (e.g., districts and divisions), while the “uncalibrated” approach performed only slightly worse. For both approaches, we found that predictions using the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), which included the red edge band available in RapidEye and Sentinel-2, were superior to those made using other commonly used vegetation indices. We also found that multiple refinements to the crop simulation procedures led to improvements in the “uncalibrated” approach. We identified the prevalence of small field sizes, intercropping management, and cloudy satellite images as major challenges to improve the model performance. Overall, this study suggested that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to map yields of smallholder farming systems, and the methodology presented in this study could serve as a good foundation for other smallholder farming systems in the world.},

abstract = {Livestock plays an important economic role in Niger, especially in the semi-arid regions, while being highly vulnerable as a result of the large inter-annual variability of precipitation and, hence, rangeland production. This study aims to support effective rangeland management by developing an approach for mapping rangeland biomass production. The observed spatiotemporal variability of biomass production is utilised to build a model based on ground and remote sensing data for the period 2001 to 2015. Once established, the model can also be used to estimate herbaceous biomass for the current year at the end of the season without the need for new ground data. The phenology-based seasonal cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (cNDVI), computed from 10-day image composites of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, was used as proxy for biomass production. A linear regression model was fitted with multi-annual field measurements of herbaceous biomass at the end of the growing season. In addition to a general model utilising all available sites for calibration, different aggregation schemes (i.e., grouping of sites into calibration units) of the study area with a varying number of calibration units and different biophysical meaning were tested. The sampling sites belonging to a specific calibration unit of a selected scheme were aggregated to compute the regression. The different aggregation schemes were evaluated with respect to their predictive power. The results gathered at the different aggregation levels were subjected to cross-validation (cv), applying a jackknife technique (leaving out one year at a time). In general, the model performance increased with increasing model parameterization, indicating the importance of additional unobserved and spatially heterogeneous agro-ecological effects (which might relate to grazing, species composition, optical soil properties, etc.) in modifying the relationship between cNDVI and herbaceous biomass at the end of the season. The biophysical aggregation scheme, the calibration units for which were derived from an unsupervised ISODATA classification utilising 10-day NDVI images taken between January 2001 and December 2015, showed the best performance in respect to the predictive power (R2cv = 0.47) and the cross-validated root-mean-square error (398 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha−1) values, although it was not the model with the highest number of calibration units. The proposed approach can be applied for the timely production of maps of estimated biomass at the end of the growing season before field measurements are made available. These maps can be used for the improved management of rangeland resources, for decisions on fire prevention and aid allocation, and for the planning of more in-depth field missions.},

abstract = {The application of crop simulation models to yield estimation on a regional scale is generally constrained by the lack of spatially distributed information on major environmental and agronomic factors affecting crop conditions. The use of remote sensing data can circumvent this problem by providing actual estimates of these conditions with various spatial and temporal resolutions. The current paper presents the development and testing of a methodological framework which utilizes NDVI data taken from satellite platforms and a simulation model (CROPSYST) to estimate wheat yield. This operation relies on two main steps, the first being the computation of wheat above-ground biomass obtained through the use of NDVI-derived FAPAR estimates. The second step consists of the final repartition of the estimated biomass into crop yield, which is obtained through the use of an harvest index computed by integrating the CROPSYST development sub-model and NDVI data. The proposed methodology was applied in two Italian provinces where wheat is widely grown (Grosseto and Foggia). In both cases, attention was first devoted to the production of multi-year NDVI data sets descriptive of wheat conditions. Next, the current methodology was applied to estimate wheat yield. The results obtained showed the high accuracy of the method in estimating wheat yield at the provincial level. Correlation coefficients equal to 0.77-0.73 were obtained between measured and simulated crop yield, with corresponding root mean square errors (RSME) of 0.47 and 0.44 Mg/ha for Grosseto and Foggia, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The classical pixel to point matching problem along with the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are some of the many issues encountered. In this study, MODIS-sensor's Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data were smoothed using two filtering techniques for comparison. Several start of season (SOS) methods established in the literature, namely thresholds of amplitude, derivatives and delayed moving average, were tested for determination of LSP-SOS for broadleaf forests at a site in southwestern Germany using 2001–2013 time series of NDVI data. The different LSP-SOS estimates when compared with species-rich GP dataset revealed that different LSP-SOS extraction methods agree better with specific phases of GP, and the choice of data processing or smoothing strongly affects the LSP-SOS extracted. LSP methods mirroring late SOS dates, i.e., 75{\%} amplitude and 1st derivative, indicated a better match in means and trends, and high, significant correlations of up to 0.7 with leaf unfolding and greening of late understory and broadleaf tree species. GP-SOS of early understory leaf unfolding partly were significantly correlated with earlier detecting LSP-SOS, i.e., 20{\%} amplitude and 3rd derivative. Early understory SOS were, however, more difficult to detect from NDVI due to the lack of a high resolution land cover information.},

abstract = {The food security of smallholder farmers is vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. Cropping intensity, the number of crops planted annually, can be used as a measure of food security for smallholder farmers given that it can greatly affect net production. Current techniques for quantifying cropping intensity may not accurately map smallholder farms where the size of one field is typically smaller than the spatial resolution of readily available satellite data. We evaluated four methods that use multi-scalar datasets and are commonly used in the literature to assess cropping intensity of smallholder farms: 1) the Landsat threshold method, which identifies if a Landsat pixel is cropped or uncropped during each growing season, 2) the MODIS peak method, which determines if there is a phenological peak in the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index time series during each growing season, 3) the MODIS temporal mixture analysis, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using phenological MODIS data, and 4) the MODIS hierarchical training method, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using hierarchical training techniques. Each method was assessed using four criteria: 1) data availability, 2) accuracy across different spatial scales (at aggregate scales 250×250m, 1×1km, 5×5km, and 10×10km), 3) ease of implementation, and 4) ability to use the method over large spatial and temporal scales. We applied our methods to two regions in India (Gujarat and southeastern Madhya Pradesh) that represented diversity in crop type, soils, climatology, irrigation access, cropping intensity, and field size. We found that the Landsat threshold method is the most accurate (R2≥0.71 and RMSE≤0.14), particularly at smaller scales of analysis. Yet given the limited availability of Landsat data, we find that the MODIS hierarchical training method meets multiple criteria for mapping cropping intensity over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the adjusted R2 between predicted and validation data generally increased and the RMSE decreased with spatial aggregation ≥5×5km (R2 up to 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.00). Our model accuracy varied based on the region and season of analysis and was lowest during the summer season in Gujarat when there was high sub-pixel heterogeneity due to sparsely cropped agricultural land-cover. While our results specifically apply to our study regions in India, they most likely also apply to smallholder agriculture in other locations across the globe where the same types of satellite data are readily available. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A new method for extracting seasonality information from time-series of satellite sensor data is presented. The method is based on nonlinear least squares fits of asymmetric Gaussian model functions to the time-series. The smooth model functions are then used for defining key seasonality parameters, such as the number of growing seasons, the beginning and end of the seasons, and the rates of growth and decline. The method is implemented in a computer program TIMESAT and tested on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data over Africa. Ancillary cloud data [clouds from AVHRR (CLAVR)] are used as estimates of the uncertainty levels of the data values. Being general in nature, the proposed method can be applied also to new types of satellite-derived time-series data.},

abstract = {Management of crops is an essential part in the food production procedure. Having a thorough knowledge of growth stages of each crop is of paramount importance in this respect. Phenology (transplanting, panicle formation, flowering etc) is the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena that are controlled by environmental and climatic factors. Monitoring the crop condition manually in the field is difficult and time consuming. Therefore recently, several methods have been introduced by using satellite derived vegetation indices. Extraction of phenological parameters is helpful for the purposes like irrigation management, nutrient management, health management, yield prediction and crop type mapping. Easily extracted parameters will be the important data base for agricultural researchers. This research is an attempt to extract paddy phenological parameters of Sri Lanka by using 16 years' (2000 to 2015) Time series MODIS Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is highly sensitive for the green vegetation and the data were analysed using SPIRITS and TIMESAT software's. Periodicity converter in SPIRITS and Savitzky Golay filtering in TIMESAT and SPIRITS are helpful in smoothing the time series which are perturbed by noise due to missing values and Clouds. Phenology is considered as a sensitive climate change indicator but, it is very essential to have a comprehensive familiarity about the method of water supply that the study area is irrigated or rain fed so as to eliminate the wrong interpretation. As results, average of long time series of NDVI profile for a few agro ecological zones of Sri Lanka with extracted seven parameters (Start of the season, End of the season, Length of the season, Booting date, Base value, Maximum NDVI during the Season, Amplitude) and generated phenological parameter maps are presented here. The crop phenology is a very important element of agricultural monitoring, to ensure the security of the food crop production.},

abstract = {In semi-arid areas, a strongly variable climate represents a major risk for food safety. An operational grain yield forecasting system, which could help decision-makers to make early assessments and plan annual imports, is thus needed. It can be challenging to monitor the crop canopy and production capacity of plants, especially cereals. In this context, the aim of the present study is to analyse the characteristics of two types of irrigated and non-irrigated cereals: barley and wheat. Through the use of a rich database, acquired over a period of two years for more than 30 test fields, and from 20 optical satellite SPOT/HRV images, two research approaches are considered. First, statistical analysis is used to characterize the vegetation's dynamics and grain yield, based on remotely sensed (satellite) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements. A relationship is established between the NDVI and LAI (leaf area index). Different robust relationships (exponential or linear) are established between the satellite NDVI index acquired from SPOT/HRV images, just before the time of maximum growth (April), and grain and straw, for barley and wheat vegetation covers. Following validation of the proposed empirical approaches, yield maps are produced for the studied site. The second approach is based on the application of a Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) growth model, developed to simulate the dynamics of the LAI and the grain yield. An inter-comparison between ground yield measurements and SAFY model simulations reveals that yields are underestimated by this model. Finally, the combination of multi-temporal satellite measurements with the SAFY model estimations is also proposed for the purposes of yield mapping. Although the results produced by the SAFY model are found to be reasonably well correlated with those determined by satellite measurements (NDVI), the grain yields are nevertheless underestimated. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We computed two sets of land cover classifications based on the NDVI and EVI time series before and after applying the Savitzky-Golay filter. The resulting classification from the filtered versions of the vegetation indices showed a substantial improvement in accuracy when compared to the classifications from the unfiltered versions. The classification by the EVIsg had the highest K̂ (0.72) for all classes compared to those of the EVI (0.67), NDVI (0.63), and NDVIsg (0.62).

abstract = {The crop developmental stage represents essential information for irrigation scheduling/fertilizer management, understanding seasonal ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, and evaluating crop productivity. In this study, we devised an approach called the Two-Step Filtering (TSF) for detecting the phenological stages of maize and soybean from time-series Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m observations. The TSF method consists of a Two-Step Filtering scheme that includes: (i) smoothing the temporal WDRVI data with a wavelet-based filter and (ii) deriving the optimum scaling parameters from shape-model fitting procedure. The date of key crop development stages are then estimated by using the optimum scaling parameters and an initial value of the specific phenological date on the shape model, which are preliminary defined in reference to ground-based crop growth stage observations. The shape model is a crop-specific WDRVI curve with typical seasonal features, which were defined by averaging smoothed, multi-year WDRVI profiles from MODIS 250-m data collected over irrigated maize and soybean study sites.In this study, the TSF method was applied to MODIS-derived WDRVI data over a 6-year period (2003 to 2008) for two irrigated sites and one rainfed site planted to either maize or soybean as part of the Carbon Sequestration Program (CSP) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. A comparison of satellite-based retrievals with ground-based crop growth stage observations collected by the CSP over the six growing seasons for these three sites showed that the TSF method can accurately estimate the date of four key phenological stages of maize (V2.5: early vegetative stage, R1: silking stage, R5: dent stage and R6: maturity) and soybean (V1: early vegetative stage, R5: beginning seed, R6: full seed and R7: beginning maturity). The root mean square error (RMSE) of phenological-stage estimation for maize ranged from 2.9 [R1] to 7.0 [R5] days and from 3.2 [R6] to 6.9 [R7] days for soybean, respectively. In addition, the TSF method was also applied for two years (2001 and 2002) over eastern Nebraska to test its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of these key phenological stages over a larger geographic area. The MODIS-derived crop phenological stage dates agreed well with the statistical crop progress data reported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) for eastern Nebraska's three crop agricultural statistic districts (ASDs). At the ASD-level, the RMSE of phenological-stage estimation ranged from 1.6 [R1] to 5.6 [R5] days for maize and from 2.5 [R7] to 5.3 [R5] days for soybean. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the climate system, impacting vegetation development, snow cover, runoff, and human livelihoods. Knowledge of LST dynamics can furthermore be used as an indicator for climate variability and change. LST is regularly measured from satellite sensors on a broad spatial scale and with a high temporal resolution. In this research, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor data are used to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of LST in the Mekong Basin (MB) including its temporal variability. The dataset contains 13 years of MODIS LST data, a unique measurement time series in terms of resolution, accuracy, and homogeneity. In the analysis a temporal granularity of 8-days was used. The MB was divided into six physiographically homogenous regions. The height and magnitude of annual LST curves differ between the regions and prove to be strongly dependent on the topography. Large intra-annual magnitudes and low temperatures (daytime/nighttime annual regional means are 14 C/7 C) are found in the northern areas, mainly in the high-lying Tibetan Plateau. The more southern areas are characterized by low LST seasonality and high temperatures (daytime/nighttime annual regional means of these regions range from 25 °C to 30°C/19°C to 25°C). The year-to-year variability of LST is similar in all regions (regional weekly daytime/nighttime deviations lower than 4°C/6°C, except for the Tibetan Plateau, where regional weekly daytime/nighttime deviations reach 6°C/18°C). In summer, 42 {\%} of daytime LST could be explained by topographic height. In winter and in nighttime scenes, topography explained 89–97 {\%} of the LST distribution. Land use and land use change further influence the LST pattern, mainly in the daytime. An example of rising LST due to deforestation is given. This study allows for an improved understanding of temperature dynamics in one of the world's largest river basins.},

However, limitations in spectral resolution and lack of accurate radiometric sensor calibration impact the utility of this rich information source. In this study, Planet's RGB imagery was translated into a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): a common metric for vegetation growth and condition. Our framework employs a data mining approach to build a set of rule-based regression models that relate RGB data to atmospherically corrected Landsat-8 NDVI. The approach was evaluated over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia where the use of near-coincident (within five days) Planet and Landsat-8 acquisitions in the training of the regression models resulted in NDVI predictabilities with an r2 of approximately 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) on the order of 0.014 ({\~{}}9{\%}). The MAD increased to 0.021 ({\~{}}14{\%}) when the Landsat NDVI training image was further away (i.e., 11–16 days) from the corrected Planet image. In these cases, the use of MODIS observations to inform on the change in NDVI occurring between overpasses was shown to significantly improve prediction accuracies. MAD levels ranged from 0.002 to 0.011 (3.9{\%} to 9.1{\%}) for the best performing 80{\%} of the data. The technique is generic and extendable to any region of interest, increasing the utility of Planet's dense time-series of RGB imagery.},

In areas of precipitation-dependent phenology such as Central Africa, it was found that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is affected approximately 20–40 days after the occurrence of precipitation, depending on land cover types. In areas of temperature-dependent phenology such as Siberia, the relationship of phenology and latitude/elevation was investigated. Using temporal NDVI data of 1982–2000, changes in seasonal NDVI pattern were classified into 11 classes and mapped in the Northern Hemisphere. From this analysis, increasing trends of the annual sum of NDVI were found in Siberia, NE Europe and the northern part of North America where good correspondence with the increasing trend of air temperature was recognized. In contrast, some areas such as the east of the Aral Sea showed a decreasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI. It was found that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the area with increasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI is approximately 12 times larger than the area with the decreasing trend. Also, it was found that areas of increasing/decreasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI correspond roughly to areas with increasing/decreasing trend of air temperature from 1982 to 1995.},

abstract = {Landsat imagery with a 30??m spatial resolution is well suited for characterizing landscape-level forest structure and dynamics. While Landsat images have advantageous spatial and spectral characteristics for describing vegetation properties, the Landsat sensor's revisit rate, or the temporal resolution of the data, is 16??days. When considering that cloud cover may impact any given acquisition, this lengthy revisit rate often results in a dearth of imagery for a desired time interval (e.g., month, growing season, or year) especially for areas at higher latitudes with shorter growing seasons. In contrast, MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) has a high temporal resolution, covering the Earth up to multiple times per day, and depending on the spectral characteristics of interest, MODIS data have spatial resolutions of 250??m, 500??m, and 1000??m. By combining Landsat and MODIS data, we are able to capitalize on the spatial detail of Landsat and the temporal regularity of MODIS acquisitions. In this research, we apply and demonstrate a data fusion approach (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM) at a mainly coniferous study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Reflectance data for selected MODIS channels, all of which were resampled to 500??m, and Landsat (at 30??m) were combined to produce 18 synthetic Landsat images encompassing the 2001 growing season (May to October). We compared, on a channel-by-channel basis, the surface reflectance values (stratified by broad land cover types) of four real Landsat images with the corresponding closest date of synthetic Landsat imagery, and found no significant difference between real (observed) and synthetic (predicted) reflectance values (mean difference in reflectance: mixed forest x?? = 0.086, ?? = 0.088, broadleaf x?? = 0.019, ?? = 0.079, coniferous x?? = 0.039, ?? = 0.093). Similarly, a pixel based analysis shows that predicted and observed reflectance values for the four Landsat dates were closely related (mean r2 = 0.76 for the NIR band; r2 = 0.54 for the red band; p {\textless} 0.01). Investigating the trend in NDVI values in synthetic Landsat values over a growing season revealed that phenological patterns were well captured; however, when seasonal differences lead to a change in land cover (i.e., disturbance, snow cover), the algorithm used to generate the synthetic Landsat images was, as expected, less effective at predicting reflectance. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Several methods exist for extracting plant phenological information from time series of satellite data. However, there have been only a few successful attempts to temporarily match satellite observations (Land Surface Phenology or LSP) with ground based phenological observations (Ground Phenology or GP). The classical pixel to point matching problem along with the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are some of the many issues encountered. In this study, MODIS-sensor's Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data were smoothed using two filtering techniques for comparison. Several start of season (SOS) methods established in the literature, namely thresholds of amplitude, derivatives and delayed moving average, were tested for determination of LSP-SOS for broadleaf forests at a site in southwestern Germany using 2001–2013 time series of NDVI data. The different LSP-SOS estimates when compared with species-rich GP dataset revealed that different LSP-SOS extraction methods agree better with specific phases of GP, and the choice of data processing or smoothing strongly affects the LSP-SOS extracted. LSP methods mirroring late SOS dates, i.e., 75{\%} amplitude and 1st derivative, indicated a better match in means and trends, and high, significant correlations of up to 0.7 with leaf unfolding and greening of late understory and broadleaf tree species. GP-SOS of early understory leaf unfolding partly were significantly correlated with earlier detecting LSP-SOS, i.e., 20{\%} amplitude and 3rd derivative. Early understory SOS were, however, more difficult to detect from NDVI due to the lack of a high resolution land cover information.},

abstract = {The global distribution of croplands is of critical interest to a wide group of end-users. Different crops have their own representative phenological stages during their growing seasons, which differ considerably from other natural vegetation types. During the last decade, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has become a key tool for vegetation monitoring because of its high temporal resolution, extensive scope, and rapid availability of various products. However, mixed pixels caused by the moderate spatial resolution produce significant errors in crop area estimation. Here we propose a Crop Proportion Phenology Index (CPPI) to express the quantitative relationship between the MODIS vegetation index (VI) time series and winter wheat crop area. The utility of this index was tested in two experimental areas in China: one around Tongzhou and the other around Shuyang, as representative districts around a metropolis and a rural area, respectively. The CPPI performed well in these two regions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) in fractional crop area predictions ranging roughly from 15{\%} in the individual pixels to 5{\%} above 6.25km 2. The training samples containing mixtures of crop types mitigated the challenges of pure end-member selection in a spectral mixture analysis. A small number of training samples are sufficient to generate the CPPI, which is adaptable to other crop types and larger regions. Estimating the CPPI parameters across larger spatial scales helped improve the stability of the model. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Crop yield estimation is of great importance to food security. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an effective crop monitoring tool, is extensively used in crop yield estimation. However, there are few studies focusing on the aspect of mixed crops grown together. In this study, a correlation-based approach for crop yield estimation is applied to three small counties (Jianshui, Luliang, and Qiubei) in the Nanpan River basin, Yunnan Province of China, and three main crops (paddy rice, winter wheat, and corn) in these areas are selected. Based on the correlation analysis between MODIS-NDVI data and crop yield, the crop planting areas as well as the best periods for a reliable estimation are identified. The best time is found approximately coinciding with the periods of heading, flowering, and filling of the crops. By Akaike's information criterion, the most fit regression models with extracted NDVI in the corresponding crop planting areas are determined. They work reasonably well in small regions, especially in the areas where crop types are unknown exactly. Further improvements to the regression models are possible by incorporating other physical factors such as soil types and geographical information.},

abstract = {Agriculture is expanding and intensifying in many areas of the world, but abandoned agriculture is also becoming more widespread. Unfortunately, data and methods to monitor abandoned agriculture accurately over large areas are lacking. Remote sensing methods may be able to fill this gap though, especially with the frequent observations provided by coarser-resolution sensors and new classification techniques. Past efforts to map abandoned agriculture relied mainly on Landsat data, making it hard to map large regions, and precluding the use of phenology information to identify abandoned agriculture. Our objective here was to test methods to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales with coarse-resolution satellite imagery and phenology data. We classified abandoned agriculture for one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) tile in Eastern Europe ({\~{}}1,236,000km 2) where abandoned agriculture was widespread. Input data included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance bands (NASA Global MODIS Terra and Aqua 16-Day Vegetation Indices for the years 2003 through 2008, {\~{}}250-m resolution), as well as phenology metrics calculated with TIMESAT. The data were classified with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Training data were derived from several Landsat classifications of agricultural abandonment in the study area. A validation was conducted based on independently collected data. Our results showed that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture for large areas from MODIS data with an overall classification accuracy of 65{\%}. Abandoned agriculture was widespread in our study area (15.1{\%} of the total area, compared to 29.6{\%} agriculture). We found strong differences in the MODIS data quality for different years, with data from 2005 resulting in the highest classification accuracy for the abandoned agriculture class (42.8{\%} producer's accuracy). Classifications of MODIS NDVI data were almost as accurate as classifications based on a combination of both red and near-infrared reflectance data. MODIS NDVI data only from the growing-season resulted in similar classification accuracy as data for the full year. Using multiple years of MODIS data did not increase classification accuracy. Six phenology metrics derived with TIMESAT from the NDVI time series (2003-2008) alone were insufficient to detect abandoned agriculture, but phenology metrics improved classification accuracies when used in conjunction with NDVI time series by more than 8{\%} over the use of NDVI data alone. The approach that we identified here is promising and suggests that it is possible to map abandoned agriculture at broad scales, which is relevant to gain a better understanding of this important land use change process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Ukraine is one of the most developed agriculture countries and one of the biggest crop producers in the world. Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived fromthe MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April-May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2-3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April-May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches wererun to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha-1in June and 0.4 t ha-1in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5-0.6 t ha-1in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system overestimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2-3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The increasingly intensive and extensive coal mining activities on the Loess Plateau pose a threat to the fragile local ecosystems. Quantifying the effects of coal mining activities on environmental conditions is of great interest for restoring and managing the local ecosystems and resources. This paper generates dense NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series between 2000 and 2011 at a spatial resolution of 30 m by blending Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and further evaluates its capability for mapping vegetation trends around a typical coalfield on the Loss Plateau. Synthetic NDVI images were generated using (1) STARFM-generated NIR (near infrared) and red band reflectance data (scheme 1) and (2) Landsat and MODIS NDVI images directly as inputs for STARFM (scheme 2). By comparing the synthetic NDVI images with the corresponding Landsat NDVI, we found that scheme 2 consistently generated better results (0.70 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.76) than scheme 1 (0.56 {\textless} R2 {\textless} 0.70) in this study area. Trend analysis was then performed with the synthetic dense NDVI time series and the annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) time series. The accuracy of these trends was evaluated by comparing to those from the corresponding MODIS time series, and it was concluded that both the trends from synthetic/MODIS NDVI dense time series and synthetic/MODIS NDVImax time series (2000–2011) were highly consistent. Compared to trends from MODIS time series, trends from synthetic time series are better able to capture fine scale vegetation changes. STARFM-generated synthetic NDVI time series could be used to quantify the effects of mining activities on vegetation, but the test areas should be selected with caution, as the trends derived from synthetic and MODIS time series may be significantly different in some areas.},

Automatic multispectral and hyperspectral sensor systems were installed in parallel with an existing eddy covariance flux tower, providing spectral information of the vegetation present at high temporal resolution. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from ground-based hyperspectral and multispectral sensors were compared with NDVI products derived from Sentinel-2A and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The influence of different spatial and temporal resolutions was assessed. High correlations and similar phenological patterns between in situ and satellite-based NDVI time series demonstrated the reliability of satellite-based phenological metrics. Sentinel-2-derived metrics showed better agreement with in situ measurements than MODIS-derived metrics. Dynamic filtering with the best index slope extraction algorithm was nevertheless beneficial for Sentinel-2 NDVI time series despite the availability of quality information from the atmospheric correction procedure.},

abstract = {Information of crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop productivity and crop management. Therefore we developed a new method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice. The method consists of three procedures: (i) prescription of multi-temporal MODIS/Terra data; (ii) filtering time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data by time-frequency analysis; and (iii) specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed EVI time profile. Applying this method to MODIS data, we determined the planting date, heading date, harvesting date, and growing period in 2002. And we validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 30 paddy fields. As for the filtering, we adopted wavelet and Fourier transforms. Three types of mother wavelet (Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet) were used in Wavelet transform. As the results of validation, the wavelet transform performed better than the Fourier transform. Specifically, the case using Coiflet (order = 4) gave remarkably good results in determining phenological stages and growing periods. The root mean square errors of the estimated phenological dates against the statistical data were: 12.1 days for planting date, 9.0 days for heading date, 10.6 days for harvesting date, and 11.0 days for growing period. The method using wavelet transform with Coiflet (order = 4) allows the determination of regional characteristics of rice phenology. We proposed this new method using the wavelet transform; Wavelet based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP). {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Four algorithms are applied on crop pixels in the Brazilian Amazonian State of Mato Grosso. Comparisons led to the selection of the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) algorithm and the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Those techniques were computed on MODIS data in order to detect six crop classes. Tests of separability show that the smoothed data improved the potential of separability at each MODIS sub-period. Moreover, supervised classifications were then realized. The WLS data refined efficiently the classification result when using C4.5 decision tree. When using the Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper classifiers, the smoothed data did not improve the classification results as compared with those obtained through original MODIS data. However, it required fewer input MODIS images to reach good results. The SG filter led to better results than the WLS algorithm when using those classifiers.},

abstract = {Long-term data archives such as Landsat offer the potential for understanding land cover dynamics over large areas, but limited progress has been made towards realizing this potential due to data availability and computational limitations. Those limitations are less relevant now, and there is renewed interest in developing reliable methods of automatically and consistently classifying time series of remotely sensed images. Our objective was to develop a method of automatically classifying temporally irregular time series (i.e., non-anniversary date images in consecutive years) of images with a minimum of parameterization and a priori information. In contrast to traditional signature extension methods, the automatic adaptive signature generalization procedure (AASG) adapts class spectral signatures to individual images and therefore requires no image correction procedure. Class signatures are derived from pixels with stable land cover through time. We tested the performance of AASG relative to traditional signature extension with various image corrections, and explored the sensitivity of AASG to a thresholding parameter (c) controlling stable site identification. AASG performed as well as signature extension with atmospheric correction ($\kappa$=0.68), and better than signature extension with relative ($\kappa$=0.65) and TOA reflectance ($\kappa$=0.56) image corrections for a summer-summer image pair. Additionally, we demonstrated the unique ability of AASG to adapt class signatures to phenological differences by classifying a summer-winter image pair with a modest reduction in overall accuracy ($\kappa$=0.66). Observed sensitivity to c supported the hypothesis of an optimum value yielding enough training sites to describe class spectral variability, but conservative enough to minimize contamination of signatures due to classification errors. AASG offers significant advantages over traditional signature extension, particularly for temporally irregular time series. Although we demonstrated a simple implementation, the AASG approach is flexible and we outline several refinements which stand to improve performance. This development represents significant progress towards realizing the potential of long-term data archives to gain long-term understandings of global land cover dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Digital analysis of remotely sensed data has become an important component of many earth-science studies. These data are often processed through a set of preprocessing or “clean-up” routines that includes a correction for atmospheric scattering, often called haze. Various methods to correct or remove the additive haze component have been developed, including the widely used dark-object subtraction technique. A problem with most of these methods is that the haze values for each spectral band are selected independently. This can create problems because atmospheric scattering is highly wavelength-dependent in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and the scattering values are correlated with each other. Therefore, multispectral data such as from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Multispectral Scanner must be corrected with haze values that are spectral band dependent. An improved dark-object subtraction technique is demonstrated that allows the user to select a relative atmospheric scattering model to predict the haze values for all the spectral bands from a selected starting band haze value. The improved method normalizes the predicted haze values for the different gain and offset parameters used by the imaging system. Examples of haze value differences between the old and improved methods for Thematic Mapper Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are 40.0, 13.0, 12.0, 8.0, 5.0, and 2.0 vs. 40.0, 13.2, 8.9, 4.9, 16.7, and 3.3, respectively, using a relative scattering model of a clear atmosphere. In one Landsat multispectral scanner image the haze value differences for Bands 4, 5, 6, and 7 were 30.0, 50.0, 50.0, and 40.0 for the old method vs. 30.0, 34.4, 43.6, and 6.4 for the new method using a relative scattering model of a hazy atmosphere.},

abstract = {Crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop production in the food insecure regions of West Africa. The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.},

@article{Atzberger2011,
abstract = {Time series of vegetation indices like NDVI are used in numerous applications ranging from ecology to climatology and agriculture. Often, these time series have to be filtered before application. The smoothing removes noise introduced by undetected clouds and poor atmospheric conditions. Ground reference measurements are usually difficult to obtain due to the medium/coarse resolution of the imagery. Hence, new filter algorithms are typically only (visually) assessed against the existing smoother. The present work aims to propose a range of quality indicators that could be useful to qualify filter performance in the absence of ground-based reference measurements. The indicators comprise (i) plausibility checks, (ii) distance metrics and (iii) geostatistical measures derived from variogram analysis. The quality measures can be readily derived from any imagery. For illustration, a large SPOT VGT dataset (1999{\^{a}}€“2008) covering South America at 1{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}km spatial resolution was filtered using the Whittaker smoother.},

abstract = {In this study we compared the Savitzky-Golay, asymmetric Gaussian, double-logistic, Whittaker smoother, and discrete Fourier transformation smoothing algorithms (noise reduction) applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data, to provide continuous phenology data used for land-cover (LC) classifications across the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (GLB). MODIS 16-day 250. m NDVI imagery for the GLB was used in conjunction with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) from 2001, 2006 and 2011, and the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) from 2011 to 2014 to conduct classification evaluations. Inter-class separability was measured by Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distances between selected cover type pairs (both general classes and specific crops), and intra-class variability was measured by calculating simple Euclidean distance for samples within cover types. For the GLB, we found that the application of a smoothing algorithm significantly reduced image noise compared to the raw data. However, the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) measures for smoothed NDVI temporal profiles resulted in large inconsistencies. Of the five algorithms tested, only the Fourier transformation algorithm and Whittaker smoother improved inter-class separability for corn-soybean class pair and significantly improved overall classification accuracy. When compared to the raw NDVI data as input, the overall classification accuracy from the Fourier transformation and Whittaker smoother improved performance by approximately 2-6{\%} for some years. Conversely, the asymmetric Gaussian and double-logistic smoothing algorithms actually led to degradation of classification performance.},

@article{Geng2014,
abstract = {More than 20 techniques have been developed to de-noise time-series vegetation index data from different satellite sensors to reconstruct long time-series data sets. Although many studies have compared Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) noise-reduction techniques, few studies have compared these techniques systematically and comprehensively. This study tested eight techniques for smoothing different vegetation types using different types of multi-temporal NDVI data (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (Global Inventory Modeling and Map Studies (GIMMS) and Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL), Satellite Pour l' Observation de la Terre (SPOT) VEGETATION (VGT), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra)) with the ultimate purpose of determining the best reconstruction technique for each type of vegetation captured with four satellite sensors. These techniques include the modified best index slope extraction (M-BISE) technique, the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) technique, the mean value iteration filter (MVI) technique, the asymmetric Gaussian (A-G) technique, the double logistic (D-L) technique, the changing-weight filter (CW) technique, the interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR) technique, and the Whittaker smoother (WS) technique. These techniques were evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results indicate that the S-G, CW, and WS techniques perform better than the other tested techniques, while the IDR, M-BISE, and MVI techniques performed worse than the other techniques. The best de-noise technique varies with different vegetation types and NDVI data sources. The S-G performs best in most situations. In addition, the CW and WS are effective techniques that were exceeded only by the S-G technique. The assessment results are consistent in terms of the three evaluation indexes for GIMMS, PAL, and SPOT data in the study area, but not for the MODIS data. The study will be very helpful for choosing reconstruction techniques for long time-series data sets.},
