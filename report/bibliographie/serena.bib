abstract = {The use of remote sensing as a tool for estimating crop production on a regional scale has been suggested for quite a while. Since the use of remotely sensed information to directly estimate crop production is questionable (primarily due to the indirect link between remotely sensed data and crop state variables), crop models may be used as a companion tool to remote sensing. Various types of crop models (statistical, deterministic, semi-empirical) are described, and specific methods (forcing, recalibration, statistical correction) are described for introducing remotely sensed information into models. The appropriance of combining different model types and sources of remotely sensed information, problems related to time scales, and the need for robust and independent phenological routines are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Wheat is one of the key cereal crops grown worldwide, providing the primary caloric and nutritional source for millions of people around the world. In order to ensure food security and sound, actionable mitigation strategies and policies for management of food shortages, timely and accurate estimates of global crop production are essential. This study combines a new BRDF-corrected, daily surface reflectance dataset developed from NASA's Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) with detailed official crop statistics to develop an empirical, generalized approach to forecast wheat yields. The first step of this study was to develop and evaluate a regression-based model for forecasting winter wheat production in Kansas. This regression-based model was then directly applied to forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine. The forecasts of production in Kansas closely matched the USDA/NASS reported numbers with a 7{\%} error. The same regression model forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine within 10{\%} of the official reported production numbers six weeks prior to harvest. Using new data from MODIS, this method is simple, has limited data requirements, and can provide an indication of winter wheat production shortfalls and surplus prior to harvest in regions where minimal ground data is available. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Red and near-infrared satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor have been processed over several days and combined to produce spatially continuous cloud-free imagery over large areas with sufficient temporal resolution to study green-vegetation dynamics. The technique minimizes cloud contamination, reduces directional reflectance and off-nadir viewing effects, minimizes sun-angle and shadow effects, and minimizes aerosol and water-vapor effects. The improvement is highly dependent on the state of the atmosphere, surface-cover type, and the viewing and illumination geometry of the sun, target and sensor. An example from southern Africa showed an increase of 40 percent from individual image values tothe final composite image. Limitations associated with the technique are discussed, and recommendations are given to improve this approach.},

@article{Zhang2003,
abstract = {Accurate measurements of regional to global scale vegetation dynamics (phenology) are required to improve models and understanding of inter-annual variability in terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions. Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Skill of seasonal precipitation forecasts for west Africa has improved to the point that forecasts may be of value to agricultural users, especially farmers. We studied agricultural production systems in three agro-ecozones of Burkina Faso to establish: (1) farmer interest in and ability to use forecasts; (2) forecast information farmers request; (3) lead-time required for greatest forecast value; (4) needs for forecast dissemination, interpretation, and application; and (5) possible strategies for using climate forecasts to improve crop production and resource management. The three agro-ecozones studied were a cotton-based system in the relatively high rainfall Sudan area of southwest Burkina Faso; a sorghum and millet based system in the low rainfall central plateau; and a cattle-based system in the very low rainfall Sahel area in the north. Potential value of forecasts to farmers differed among the three zones, with greatest apparent value to farmers of the central plateau and least apparent value to cattle herders of the Sahel. While farmers in all three agro-ecozones expressed a strong interest in receiving seasonal precipitation forecasts, they were much more interested in receiving forecasts of when the rains would start and end, and whether there would be interruptions in rains. Our results suggest that if seasonal precipitation forecasts are disseminated, they should be a part of an extension package that includes discussion of the probabilistic nature of the forecasts, potential response strategies, and risk management. Furthermore, farmers may need greater access to basic agricultural technologies, such as plows, new crop varieties, and fertilizers, before they can benefit fully from precipitation forecasts. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This study empirically compared noise reduction techniques for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series based on a new absolute measure using a time-series of 16-day composite NDVI images extracted from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products covering the Poyang Lake area in China. We proposed an approach to accurately extract representative NDVI temporal profiles for the 12 land cover cluster types by clustering profiles, selecting optimal number of clusters, merging and labeling clusters, and selecting the representative NDVI profiles. The geometric average of the mean average distance between the reconstructed profile and the raw profiles, and the mean average distance between the reconstructed profile and the upper envelope (Dg(nr,. c)) was selected as the most appropriate measure substitutive to RMSE for the evaluation of the noise reduction effects, when the 'true' profiles were not available. The running median, mean value, maximum operation, end point processing, and Hanning smoothing (RMMEH) filter and iterative Savitzky-Golay filter were the two most appropriate noise reduction techniques for the NDVI temporal profiles of the study area in the evaluation of noise reduction effects by the seven techniques. The robust framework using the proposed approach for the accurate extraction of representative NDVI temporal profiles and (Dg(nr,. c)) in this study, is applicable in the evaluation of noise reduction effects using different techniques and in other study areas. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Time series of vegetation indices like NDVI are used in numerous applications ranging from ecology to climatology and agriculture. Often, these time series have to be filtered before application. The smoothing removes noise introduced by undetected clouds and poor atmospheric conditions. Ground reference measurements are usually difficult to obtain due to the medium/coarse resolution of the imagery. Hence, new filter algorithms are typically only (visually) assessed against the existing smoother. The present work aims to propose a range of quality indicators that could be useful to qualify filter performance in the absence of ground-based reference measurements. The indicators comprise (i) plausibility checks, (ii) distance metrics and (iii) geostatistical measures derived from variogram analysis. The quality measures can be readily derived from any imagery. For illustration, a large SPOT VGT dataset (1999{\^{a}}€“2008) covering South America at 1{\^{a}}€{\v{S}}km spatial resolution was filtered using the Whittaker smoother.},

abstract = {From in situ measured woody cover we develop a phenology driven model to estimate the canopy cover of woody species in the Sahelian drylands at 1km scale. The model estimates the total canopy cover of all woody phanerophytes and the concept is based on the significant difference in phenophases of dryland trees, shrubs and bushes as compared to that of the herbaceous plants. Whereas annual herbaceous plants are only green during the rainy season and senescence occurs shortly after flowering towards the last rains, most woody plants remain photosynthetically active over large parts of the year. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - VEGETATION (VGT) Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) time series and test 10 metrics representing the annual FAPAR dynamics for their ability to reproduce in situ woody cover at 43 sites (163 observations between 1993 and 2013) in the Sahel. Both multi-year field data and satellite metrics are averaged to produce a steady map. Multiple regression models using the integral of FAPAR from the onset of the dry season to the onset of the rainy season, the start date of the growing season and the rate of decrease of the FAPAR curve achieve a cross validated r2/RMSE (in {\%} woody cover) of 0.73/3.0 (MODIS) and 0.70/3.2 (VGT). The extrapolation to Sahel scale shows agreement between VGT and MODIS at an almost nine times higher woody cover than in the global tree cover product MOD44B which only captures trees of a certain minimum size. The derived woody cover map of the Sahel is made publicly available and represents an improvement of existing products and a contribution for future studies of drylands quantifying carbon stocks, climate change assessment, as well as parametrization of vegetation dynamic models.},

abstract = {Field studies were conducted at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Niamey, Niger, during 1986 and 1987 to test the methodology described earlier by Sivakumar (1988) that the potential of the rainy season in the Sahelian zone of West Africa can be determined from the date of onset of rains. We tested an early onset of rains treatment (imposed with supplemental irrigations) with the natural onset of rains. In 1986, natural onset was early while in 1987 it was considerably late. In both the seasons, dry matter production of millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) in the early onset of rains treatment reached 7 t ha-1while late onset of rains resulted in only 3 t ha-1. Data on soil water profiles showed that at the time of the millet harvest in the early rains treatment, profile soil water is adequate to establish a second crop of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) for hay. This enables efficient exploitation of soil moisture. In addition, the combined water use of the two crops in the early rains treatment was much higher. Results of this study suggest that by tailoring management tactics to weather conditions, in years with early onset of rains it is possible to establish a second crop of cowpea for hay in the Sahelian zone where the farmers traditionally grow only millet. The implications of the suggested methodology for other climatic zones in West Africa and its limitations are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Pastoralist households across East Africa face major livestock losses during drought periods that can cause persistent poverty. For Kenya and southern Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season NDVI data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March-September for long rains, October-February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) our aim was to identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250. m-resolution 10-day NDVI composites for 2001-2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and end-dates using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most ({\textgreater}. 90{\%}) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines.},

Besides low resolution sensors as SPOT-VGT and NOAA-AVHRR, medium resolution data from TERRA/AQUA-MODIS or ENVISAT-MERIS are used at pan-European level. In case of available time series, esp. NOAA-AVHRR (since 1981) and SPOT-VGT (since 1998) difference values of the indicators (e.g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e.g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The exploitation of the data is performed at full resolution, at grid level of the MCYFS or regional unmixed means (C-indicators) are used. Therefore a database has been set-up in order to provide the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The current work aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects. Therefore, existing methods as simple sliding windows, piecewise linear regression or fitting of polynomial functions are employed and compared. Thereafter, the time series analysis is performed with the aim to establish relationships between indicators profile features and the crop phenology},

abstract = {Soil fertility in smallholder farming areas is known to vary strongly on multiple scales. This study measures the sensitivity of the recorded satellite signal to on-farm soil fertility treatments applied to five crop types, and quantifies this fertilization effect with respect to within-field variation, between-field variation and field position in the catena. Plant growth was assessed in 5–6 plots per field in 48 fields located in the Sudano-Sahelian agro-ecological zone of southeastern Mali. A unique series of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In this experiment, for half of the fields at least 50{\%} of the NDVI variance within a field was due to fertilization. Moreover, the sensitivity of NDVI to fertilizer application was crop-dependent and varied through the season, with optima at the end of August for peanut and cotton and early October for sorghum and maize. The influence of fertilizer on NDVI was comparatively small at the landscape scale (up to 35{\%} of total variation), relative to the influence of other components of variation such as field management and catena position. The NDVI response could only partially be benchmarked against a fertilization reference within the field. We conclude that comparisons of the spatial and temporal responses of NDVI, with respect to fertilization and crop management, requires a stratification of soil catena-related crop growth conditions at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Several models have been fitted in the past to smooth time-series vegetation index data from different satellite sensors to estimate vegetation phenological parameters. However, differences between the models and fine tuning of model parameters lead to potential differences, uncertainty and bias between the results amongst users. The current research assessed four techniques: Fourier analysis, asymmetric Gaussian model, double logistic model and the Whittaker filter for smoothing multi-temporal satellite sensor observations with the ultimate purpose of deriving an appropriate annual vegetation growth cycle and estimating phenological parameters reliably. The research used Level 3 Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS, spatial resolution {\~{}}. 4.6. km) Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) data over the years 2004 to 2006 composited at eight day intervals covering the Indian sub-continent. First, the four models were fitted to representative sample time-series of the major vegetation types in India, and the quality of the fit was analysed. Second, the effect of noise on model fitting was analysed by adding Gaussian noise to a standard profile. Finally, the four models were fitted to the whole study area to characterise variation in the quality of model fitting as a function of single and double vegetation seasons. These smoothed data were used to estimate the onset of greenness (OG), a major phenological parameter. The models were evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The first test (fitting to representative sample time series) revealed the consistently superior performance of the Whittaker and Fourier approaches in most cases. The second test (fitting after the addition of Gaussian noise) revealed the superior performance of the double logistic and Fourier approaches. Finally, when the approaches were applied to the whole study, thus, including vegetation with different phenological profiles and multiple growing seasons (third test), it was found that it was necessary to tune each of the models according to the number of annual growing seasons to produce reliable fits. The double logistic and asymmetric Gaussian models did not perform well for areas with more than one growing season per year. The mean absolute deviation in OG derived from these models was a maximum (3 to 4. weeks) within the dry deciduous vegetation type and minimum (1. week) in evergreen vegetation. All techniques yielded consistent results over the south-western and north-eastern regions of India characterised by tropical climate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Regional phenology is important in ecosystem simulation models and coupled biosphere/atmosphere models. In the continental United States, the timing of the onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-off) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and climatological data. Predictions were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km x 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7.2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6.1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5.3 days in the DBF biome and 6.3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95{\%} probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lilac phenology. Continental application of the phenology models for 1990-1992 revealed extensive interannual variability in onset and offset. Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of 129 days in 1991 to a high of 146 days in 1992. Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.},

Comparisons led to the selection of the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) algorithm and the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Those techniques were computed on MODIS data in order to detect six crop classes. Tests of separability show that the smoothed data improved the potential of separability at each MODIS sub-period. Moreover, supervised classifications were then realized. The WLS data refined efficiently the classification result when using C4.5 decision tree. When using the Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper classifiers, the smoothed data did not improve the classification results as compared with those obtained through original MODIS data. However, it required fewer input MODIS images to reach good results. The SG filter led to better results than the WLS algorithm when using those classifiers.},

abstract = {Quantitative estimates of forage availability at the end of the growing season in rangelands are helpful for pastoral livestock managers and for local, national and regional stakeholders in natural resource management. For this reason, remote sensing data such as the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) have been widely used to assess Sahelian plant productivity for about 40 years. This study combines traditional FAPAR-based assessments with agrometeorological variables computed by the geospatial water balance program, GeoWRSI, using rainfall and potential evapotranspiration satellite gridded data to estimate the annual herbaceous yield in the semi-arid areas of Senegal. It showed that a machine-learning model combining FAPAR seasonal metrics with various agrometeorological data provided better estimations of the in situ annual herbaceous yield (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 483 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) than models based exclusively on FAPAR metrics (R2 = 0.63; RMSE = 550 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha) or agrometeorological variables (R2 = 0.55; RMSE = 585 kg{\textperiodcentered}DM/ha). All the models provided reasonable outputs and showed a decrease in the mean annual yield with increasing latitude, together with an increase in relative inter-annual variation. In particular, the additional use of agrometeorological information mitigated the saturation effects that characterize the plant indices of areas with high plant productivity. In addition, the date of the onset of the growing season derived from smoothed FAPAR seasonal dynamics showed no significant relationship (0.05 p-level) with the annual herbaceous yield across the whole studied area. The date of the onset of rainfall however, was significantly related to the herbaceous yield and its inclusion in fodder biomass models could constitute a significant improvement in forecasting risks of a mass herbaceous deficit at an early stage of the year.},

abstract = {The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of − 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2–4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1–3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground-based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8–10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2–3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1–2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1–3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.},

abstract = {For the semiarid Sahelian region, climate variability is one of the most important risks of food insecurity. Field experimentations as well as crop modeling are helpful tools for the monitoring and the understanding of yields at local scale. However, extrapolation of these methods at a regional scale remains a demanding task. Remote sensing observations appear as a good alternative or addition to existing crop monitoring systems. In this study, a new approach based on the combination of vegetation and thermal indices for rainfed cereal yield assessment in the Sahelian region was investigated. Empirical statistical models were developed between MODIS NDVI and LST variables and the crop model SARRA-H simulated aboveground biomass and harvest index in order to assess each component of the yield equation. The resulting model was successfully applied at the Niamey Square Degree (NSD) site scale with yield estimations close to the official agricultural statistics of Niger for a period of 11 years (2000-2011) (r = 0.82,p-value {\textless} 0.05). The combined NDVI and LST indices-based model was found to clearly outperform the model based on NDVI alone (r = 0.59,$\backslash$ {\textless} 0.10). In areas where access to ground measurements is difficult, a simple, robust, and timely satellite-based model combining vegetation and thermal indices from MODIS and calibrated using crop model outputs can be pertinent. In particular, such a model can provide an assessment of the year-To-year yield variability shortly after harvest for regions with agronomic and climate characteristics close to those of the NSD study area.},

abstract = {Many remote sensing applications are devoted to the agricultural sector. Representative case studies are presented in the special issue “Advances in Remote Sensing of Agriculture”. To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.},

abstract = {Using the National Oceanic {\&} Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Aeronautics {\&} Space Administration (NASA) Pathfinder Land dataset (PAL data) from 1982–2000, vegetation phenology (onset, peak and offset) was defined and analysed with climate data. In areas of precipitation-dependent phenology such as Central Africa, it was found that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is affected approximately 20–40 days after the occurrence of precipitation, depending on land cover types. In areas of temperature-dependent phenology such as Siberia, the relationship of phenology and latitude/elevation was investigated. Using temporal NDVI data of 1982–2000, changes in seasonal NDVI pattern were classified into 11 classes and mapped in the Northern Hemisphere. From this analysis, increasing trends of the annual sum of NDVI were found in Siberia, NE Europe and the northern part of North America where good correspondence with the increasing trend of air temperature was recognized. In contrast, some areas such as the east of the Aral Sea showed a decreasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI. It was found that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the area with increasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI is approximately 12 times larger than the area with the decreasing trend. Also, it was found that areas of increasing/decreasing trend of the annual sum of NDVI correspond roughly to areas with increasing/decreasing trend of air temperature from 1982 to 1995.},

abstract = {In this study, the authors investigate farmers' vulnerability to climate variability and evaluate local adoption of technology and farmers' perceptions of adaptation strategies to rainfall variability and policies. A survey was conducted in a community in northern Burkina Faso following the crop failure of 2004. In 2006, following a better harvest, another survey was conducted to compare farmers' actions and reactions during two contrasted rainy seasons. The results confirm that farmers from this community have substantially changed their practices during the last few decades. They have adopted a wide range of techniques that are intended to simultaneously increase crop yield and reduce yield variability. Micro water harvesting (Za{\"{i}}) techniques have been widely adopted (41{\%}), and a majority of fields have been improved with stone lines (60{\%}). Hay (48{\%}) and sorghum residues are increasingly stored to feed animals during the dry season, making bull and sheep fattening now a common practice. Dry season vegetable production also involves a majority of the population (60{\%}). According to farmers, most of the new techniques have been adopted because of growing land scarcity and new market opportunities, rather than because of climate variability. Population pressure has reached a critical threshold, while land scarcity, declining soil fertility and reduced animal mobility have pushed farmers to intensify agricultural production. These techniques reduce farmers' dependency on rainfall but are still insufficient to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Thirty-nine percent of the population remains vulnerable after a good rainy season. Despite farmers' desire to remain in their own communities, migrations are likely to remain a major source of regular income and form of recourse in the event of droughts.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of crop production in smallholder farming systems are critical to the understanding of yield constraints and, thus, setting the appropriate agronomic investments and policies for improving food security and reducing poverty. Nevertheless, mapping the yields of smallholder farms is challenging because of factors such as small field sizes and heterogeneous landscapes. Recent advances in fine-resolution satellite sensors offer promise for monitoring and characterizing the production of smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the utility of different sensors, including the commercial Skysat and RapidEye satellites and the publicly accessible Sentinel-2, for tracking smallholder maize yield variation throughout a {\~{}}40,000 km2 western Kenya region. We tested the potential of two types of multiple regression models for predicting yield: (i) a “calibrated model”, which required ground-measured yield and weather data for calibration, and (ii) an “uncalibrated model”, which used a process-based crop model to generate daily vegetation index and end-of-season biomass and/or yield as pseudo training samples. Model performance was evaluated at the field, division, and district scales using a combination of farmer surveys and crop cuts across thousands of smallholder plots in western Kenya. Results show that the “calibrated” approach captured a significant fraction (R2 between 0.3 and 0.6) of yield variations at aggregated administrative units (e.g., districts and divisions), while the “uncalibrated” approach performed only slightly worse. For both approaches, we found that predictions using the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), which included the red edge band available in RapidEye and Sentinel-2, were superior to those made using other commonly used vegetation indices. We also found that multiple refinements to the crop simulation procedures led to improvements in the “uncalibrated” approach. We identified the prevalence of small field sizes, intercropping management, and cloudy satellite images as major challenges to improve the model performance. Overall, this study suggested that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to map yields of smallholder farming systems, and the methodology presented in this study could serve as a good foundation for other smallholder farming systems in the world.},

abstract = {Current remote sensing studies of phenology have been limited to coarse spatial or temporal resolution and often lack a direct link to field measurements. To address this gap, we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive field measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices, five mathematical fits to model a continuous temporal response, and a suite of threshold estimates for "start of spring/season" (SOS) assessments were compared to field measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency, leaf area index, greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least five spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to field metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11. days for all species and elevation combinations, but improved to 9. days for hardwood dominated plots and 7. days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8. days when forest type (mixed, conifer hardwood) was used to refine predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low, inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology over time. This was confirmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12. days of mean absolute error. However, image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Remote sensing offers a low-cost method for developing spatially continuous crop production statistics across large areas and through time. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia ({\textless}2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R2 = 0.41 in 2014–2015 and R2 = 0.62 in 2015–2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R2 = 0.27 in 2014–2015 and R2 = 0.33 in 2015–2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large range in sow dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e.g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, it is likely that the methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years.},

abstract = {Monitoring crop condition and yields at regional scales using imagery from operational satellites remains a challenge because of the problem in scaling local yield simulations to the regional scales. NOAA AVHRR satellite imagery has been traditionally used to monitor vegetation changes that are used indirectly to assess crop condition and yields. Additionally, the 1-km spatial resolution of NOAA AVHRR is not adequate for monitoring crops at the field level. Imagery from the new MODIS sensor onboard the NASA Terra satellite offers an excellent opportunity for daily coverage at 250-m resolution, which is adequate to monitor field sizes are larger than 25 ha. A field study was conducted in the predominantly corn and soybean area of Iowa to evaluate the applicability of the 8-day MODIS composite imagery in operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate the models. The MODIS data was used in a radiative transfer model to estimate LAI through the season. LAI was integrated into a climate-based crop simulation model to scale from local simulation of crop development and responses to a regional scale. Simulations of corn and soybean yields at a 1.6×1.6-km2grid scale were comparable to county yields reported by the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Weekly changes in soil moisture for the top 1-m profile were also simulated as part of the crop model as one of the critical parameters influencing crop condition and yields. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the "Shape-Model Fitting Method". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10. days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10{\%} especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, these time series are associated with significant uncertainties and incomplete because of cloud cover. This study compares eight methods designed to improve the continuity by filling gaps and consistency by smoothing the time course. It includes methods exploiting the time series as a whole (iterative caterpillar singular spectrum analysis (ICSSA), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), low pass filtering (LPF) and Whittaker smoother (Whit)) as well as methods working on limited temporal windows of a few weeks to few months (adaptive Savitzky–Golay filter (SGF), temporal smoothing and gap filling (TSGF), and asymmetric Gaussian function (AGF)), in addition to the simple climatological LAI yearly profile (Clim). Methods were applied to the MODIS leaf area index product for the period 2000–2008 and over 25 sites showed a large range of seasonal patterns. Performances were discussed with emphasis on the balance achieved by each method between accuracy and roughness depending on the fraction of missing observations and the length of the gaps. Results demonstrate that the EMD, LPF and AGF methods were failing because of a significant fraction of gaps (more than 20{\%}), while ICSSA, Whit and SGF were always providing estimates for dates with missing data. TSGF (Clim) was able to fill more than 50{\%} of the gaps for sites with more than 60{\%} (80{\%}) fraction of gaps. However, investigation of the accuracy of the reconstructed values shows that it degrades rapidly for sites with more than 20{\%} missing data, particularly for ICSSA, Whit and SGF. In these conditions, TSGF provides the best performances that are significantly better than the simple Clim for gaps shorter than about 100 days. The roughness of the reconstructed temporal profiles shows large differences between the various methods, with a decrease of the roughness with the fraction of missing data, except for ICSSA. TSGF provides the smoothest temporal profiles for sites with a {\%} gap {\textgreater} 30{\%}. Conversely, ICSSA, LPF, Whit, AGF and Clim provide smoother profiles than TSGF for sites with a {\%} gap {\textless} 30{\%}. Impact of the accuracy and smoothness of the reconstructed time series were evaluated on the timing of phenological stages. The dates of start, maximum and end of the season are estimated with an accuracy of about 10 days for the sites with a {\%} gap {\textless} 10{\%} and increases rapidly with the {\%} gap. TSGF provides more accurate estimates of phenological timing up to a {\%} gap {\textless} 60{\%}.},

abstract = {This study aims at developing a robust and generic methodology, based on the use of high resolution remote sensing data to provide accurate estimates of maize biomass and yield over large areas (i.e. at regional scale). We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R = 0.98; RRMSE = 14{\%}) and yield (R = 0.81; RRMSE = 8.9{\%}), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R = 0.96; RRMSE = 4.6{\%}). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.},

abstract = {A variety of approaches are available to fill the gaps in the time series of vegetation parameters estimated from satellite observations. In this paper, a scheme considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability was proposed to evaluate the gap-filling approaches. Six approaches for gap filling were globally evaluated pixel-by-pixel based on a reference NDVI generated from MODIS observations during the past 15 years. The evaluated approaches include the Fourier-based approach (Fourier), the double logistic model (DL), the iterative interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR), the Whittaker smoother (Whit), the Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) and the locally adjusted cubic spline capping approach (LACC). Considering the five aspects, the ranks of the overall performance are LACC {\textgreater} Fourier {\textgreater} IDR {\textgreater} DL {\textgreater} SG {\textgreater} Whit. The six approaches are similar in filling the gaps and remaining the curve stability but there are large difference in protection of key points and noise resistance. The SG is sensitive to noises and the Whit is poor in protection of key points. In the monsoon regions of India, all evaluated approaches don't work well. This paper provides some new views for evaluating the gap filling approaches that will be helpful in selecting the optimal approach to reconstruct the time series of parameters for data applications.},

A validation site for Sentinel-2 products was hence established in central Germany. Automatic multispectral and hyperspectral sensor systems were installed in parallel with an existing eddy covariance flux tower, providing spectral information of the vegetation present at high temporal resolution. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from ground-based hyperspectral and multispectral sensors were compared with NDVI products derived from Sentinel-2A and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The influence of different spatial and temporal resolutions was assessed. High correlations and similar phenological patterns between in situ and satellite-based NDVI time series demonstrated the reliability of satellite-based phenological metrics. Sentinel-2-derived metrics showed better agreement with in situ measurements than MODIS-derived metrics. Dynamic filtering with the best index slope extraction algorithm was nevertheless beneficial for Sentinel-2 NDVI time series despite the availability of quality information from the atmospheric correction procedure.},

abstract = {Ukraine is one of the most developed agriculture countries and one of the biggest crop producers in the world. Timely and accurate crop yield forecasts for Ukraine at regional level become a key element in providing support to policy makers in food security. In this paper, feasibility and relative efficiency of using moderate resolution satellite data to winter wheat forecasting in Ukraine at oblast level is assessed. Oblast is a sub-national administrative unit that corresponds to the NUTS2 level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) of the European Union. NDVI values were derived fromthe MODIS sensor at the 250 m spatial resolution. For each oblast NDVI values were averaged for a cropland map (Rainfed croplands class) derived from the ESA GlobCover map, and were used as predictors in the regression models. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the best time for making reliable yield forecasts in terms of root mean square error was identified. For most oblasts, NDVI values taken in April-May provided the minimum RMSE value when comparing to the official statistics, thus enabling forecasts 2-3 months prior to harvest. The NDVI-based approach was compared to the following approaches: empirical model based on meteorological observations (with forecasts in April-May that provide minimum RMSE value) and WOFOST crop growth simulation model implemented in the CGMS system (with forecasts in June that provide minimum RMSE value). All three approaches wererun to produce winter wheat yield forecasts for independent datasets for 2010 and 2011, i.e. on data that were not used within model calibration process. The most accurate predictions for 2010 were achieved using the CGMS system with the RMSE value of 0.3 t ha-1in June and 0.4 t ha-1in April, while performance of three approaches for 2011 was almost the same (0.5-0.6 t ha-1in April). Both NDVI-based approach and CGMS system overestimated winter wheat yield comparing to official statistics in 2010, and underestimated it in 2011. Therefore, we can conclude that performance of empirical NDVI-based regression model was similar to meteorological and CGMS models when producing winter wheat yield forecasts at oblast level in Ukraine 2-3 months prior to harvest, while providing minimum requirements to input datasets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {More than 20 techniques have been developed to de-noise time-series vegetation index data from different satellite sensors to reconstruct long time-series data sets. Although many studies have compared Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) noise-reduction techniques, few studies have compared these techniques systematically and comprehensively. This study tested eight techniques for smoothing different vegetation types using different types of multi-temporal NDVI data (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (Global Inventory Modeling and Map Studies (GIMMS) and Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL), Satellite Pour l' Observation de la Terre (SPOT) VEGETATION (VGT), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Terra)) with the ultimate purpose of determining the best reconstruction technique for each type of vegetation captured with four satellite sensors. These techniques include the modified best index slope extraction (M-BISE) technique, the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) technique, the mean value iteration filter (MVI) technique, the asymmetric Gaussian (A-G) technique, the double logistic (D-L) technique, the changing-weight filter (CW) technique, the interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR) technique, and the Whittaker smoother (WS) technique. These techniques were evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE), the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The results indicate that the S-G, CW, and WS techniques perform better than the other tested techniques, while the IDR, M-BISE, and MVI techniques performed worse than the other techniques. The best de-noise technique varies with different vegetation types and NDVI data sources. The S-G performs best in most situations. In addition, the CW and WS are effective techniques that were exceeded only by the S-G technique. The assessment results are consistent in terms of the three evaluation indexes for GIMMS, PAL, and SPOT data in the study area, but not for the MODIS data. The study will be very helpful for choosing reconstruction techniques for long time-series data sets.},

abstract = {Several vegetation indices were developed by ratioing or linear combinations of different spectral bands to characterize vegetation status with remote sensing measurements. These indices are primarily sensitive to vegetation, but also to non vegetation related factors such as soil background variations, atmospheric conditions, and sensor viewing geometries. Consequently, there is a need to quantify these effects when utilizing these vegetation indices. A sensitivity analysis of existing vegetation indices was made using both modeled spectral data and ground based remote sensing measurements. The analysis was made with respect to soil background, atmosphere, and sensor viewing geometries. General criteria to evaluate vegetation indices were established, and based on these criteria, a new index was developed. The new index was developed by adapting the reflectance in blue region for the atmospheric corrections in the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). The resultant Atmosphere Soil Vegetation Index (ASVI) was compared with other indices and it increased vegetation sensitivity while further reducing soil and atmospheric effects. However, differences found among these vegetation indices may not be statistically significant, and further studies are, therefore, needed with satellite and ground based data.},

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an effective crop monitoring tool, is extensively used in crop yield estimation. However, there are few studies focusing on the aspect of mixed crops grown together. In this study, a correlation-based approach for crop yield estimation is applied to three small counties (Jianshui, Luliang, and Qiubei) in the Nanpan River basin, Yunnan Province of China, and three main crops (paddy rice, winter wheat, and corn) in these areas are selected. Based on the correlation analysis between MODIS-NDVI data and crop yield, the crop planting areas as well as the best periods for a reliable estimation are identified. The best time is found approximately coinciding with the periods of heading, flowering, and filling of the crops. By Akaike's information criterion, the most fit regression models with extracted NDVI in the corresponding crop planting areas are determined. They work reasonably well in small regions, especially in the areas where crop types are unknown exactly. Further improvements to the regression models are possible by incorporating other physical factors such as soil types and geographical information.},

abstract = {The application of crop simulation models to yield estimation on a regional scale is generally constrained by the lack of spatially distributed information on major environmental and agronomic factors affecting crop conditions. The use of remote sensing data can circumvent this problem by providing actual estimates of these conditions with various spatial and temporal resolutions. The current paper presents the development and testing of a methodological framework which utilizes NDVI data taken from satellite platforms and a simulation model (CROPSYST) to estimate wheat yield. This operation relies on two main steps, the first being the computation of wheat above-ground biomass obtained through the use of NDVI-derived FAPAR estimates. The second step consists of the final repartition of the estimated biomass into crop yield, which is obtained through the use of an harvest index computed by integrating the CROPSYST development sub-model and NDVI data. The proposed methodology was applied in two Italian provinces where wheat is widely grown (Grosseto and Foggia). In both cases, attention was first devoted to the production of multi-year NDVI data sets descriptive of wheat conditions. Next, the current methodology was applied to estimate wheat yield. The results obtained showed the high accuracy of the method in estimating wheat yield at the provincial level. Correlation coefficients equal to 0.77-0.73 were obtained between measured and simulated crop yield, with corresponding root mean square errors (RSME) of 0.47 and 0.44 Mg/ha for Grosseto and Foggia, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (≥250m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (≤30m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.},

abstract = {Satellite imagery provides a unique vantage point for observing seasonal dynamics of the landscape that have implications for global change issues. An objective evaluation of surface conditions may be performed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer data. NDVI data are typically very noisy, affected by a number of phenomena including cloud contamination, atmospheric perturbations, and variable illumination and viewing geometry, each of which usually reduces the NDVI. This work describes a weighted least-squares linear regression approach to temporal NDVI smoothing to more efficiently reduce contamination in the NDVI signal. This approach uses a moving window operating on temporal NDVI to calculate a regression line. The window is moved one period at a time, resulting in a family of regression lines associated with each point; this family of lines is then averaged at each point and interpolated between points to provide a continuous temporal NDVI signal. Also, since the factors that cause contamination usually serve to reduce NDVI values, the system applies a weighting factor that favors peak points over sloping or valley points. A final operation assures that all peak NDVI values are retained. The resulting relationship between the smoothed curve and the original data is statistically based. The smoothed data may be used to improve applications involving time-series NDVI data, such as land cover classification, seasonal vegetation characterization, and vegetation monitoring.},

However, limitations in spectral resolution and lack of accurate radiometric sensor calibration impact the utility of this rich information source. In this study, Planet's RGB imagery was translated into a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): a common metric for vegetation growth and condition. Our framework employs a data mining approach to build a set of rule-based regression models that relate RGB data to atmospherically corrected Landsat-8 NDVI. The approach was evaluated over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia where the use of near-coincident (within five days) Planet and Landsat-8 acquisitions in the training of the regression models resulted in NDVI predictabilities with an r2 of approximately 0.97 and a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) on the order of 0.014 ({\~{}}9{\%}). The MAD increased to 0.021 ({\~{}}14{\%}) when the Landsat NDVI training image was further away (i.e., 11–16 days) from the corrected Planet image. In these cases, the use of MODIS observations to inform on the change in NDVI occurring between overpasses was shown to significantly improve prediction accuracies. MAD levels ranged from 0.002 to 0.011 (3.9{\%} to 9.1{\%}) for the best performing 80{\%} of the data. The technique is generic and extendable to any region of interest, increasing the utility of Planet's dense time-series of RGB imagery.},

abstract = {Low resolution satellite imagery has been extensively used for crop monitoring and yield forecasting for over 30 years and plays an important role in a growing number of operational systems. The combination of their high temporal frequency with their extended geographical coverage generally associated with low costs per area unit makes these images a convenient choice at both national and regional scales. Several qualitative and quantitative approaches can be clearly distinguished, going from the use of low resolution satellite imagery as the main predictor of final crop yield to complex crop growth models where remote sensing-derived indicators play different roles, depending on the nature of the model and on the availability of data measured on the ground. Vegetation performance anomaly detection with low resolution images continues to be a fundamental component of early warning and drought monitoring systems at the regional scale. For applications at more detailed scales, the limitations created by the mixed nature of low resolution pixels are being progressively reduced by the higher resolution offered by new sensors, while the continuity of existing systems remains crucial for ensuring the availability of long time series as needed by the majority of the yield prediction methods used today.},

abstract = {Several methods exist for extracting plant phenological information from time series of satellite data. However, there have been only a few successful attempts to temporarily match satellite observations (Land Surface Phenology or LSP) with ground based phenological observations (Ground Phenology or GP). The classical pixel to point matching problem along with the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data are some of the many issues encountered. In this study, MODIS-sensor's Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data were smoothed using two filtering techniques for comparison. Several start of season (SOS) methods established in the literature, namely thresholds of amplitude, derivatives and delayed moving average, were tested for determination of LSP-SOS for broadleaf forests at a site in southwestern Germany using 2001–2013 time series of NDVI data. The different LSP-SOS estimates when compared with species-rich GP dataset revealed that different LSP-SOS extraction methods agree better with specific phases of GP, and the choice of data processing or smoothing strongly affects the LSP-SOS extracted. LSP methods mirroring late SOS dates, i.e., 75{\%} amplitude and 1st derivative, indicated a better match in means and trends, and high, significant correlations of up to 0.7 with leaf unfolding and greening of late understory and broadleaf tree species. GP-SOS of early understory leaf unfolding partly were significantly correlated with earlier detecting LSP-SOS, i.e., 20{\%} amplitude and 3rd derivative. Early understory SOS were, however, more difficult to detect from NDVI due to the lack of a high resolution land cover information.},

abstract = {Assessing how environmental changes affect the distribution and dynamics of vegetation and animal populations is becoming increasingly important for terrestrial ecologists to enable better predictions of the effects of global warming, biodiversity reduction or habitat degradation. The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effects of different nitrogen supplies on the performance of the short-day cultivar M9D3 of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L. R.Br.) and their interaction with sowing time were analyzed in a two-year experiment in Mali. The first sowing dates coincided with the beginning of the rainy season. The second sowings were 20 days later. The sowing date affected only the emergence-earing duration independently of nitrogen application. The linear reduction in straw yield, caused by the shortening of the cycle, was not combined with a reduction in grain yield. The application of even low levels of nitrogen to millet crops always increased the grain yield, as a consequence of a higher number of productive panicles, while the straw production was positively affected only when the rainy season started early. The non-agreement between the high productive potential of the first sowing crops and their grain yield, in comparison with the plants of the second sowing date, could be ascribed, first of all, to the more marked asynchrony between the time corresponding to LAImax and the grain filling phase, characterized by the maximum sink demand and, second, to a longer time interval during which stem growth and panicle growth are in direct competition.},

The resulting classification from the filtered versions of the vegetation indices showed a substantial improvement in accuracy when compared to the classifications from the unfiltered versions. The classification by the EVIsg had the highest K̂ (0.72) for all classes compared to those of the EVI (0.67), NDVI (0.63), and NDVIsg (0.62).

abstract = {NOAA AVHRR has been used extensively for monitoring vegetation condition and changes across the United States. Integration of crop growth models with MODIS imagery at 250 m resolution from the Terra Satellite potentially offers an opportunity for operational assessment of the crop condition and yield at both field and regional scales. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of the MODIS 250 m resolution data for retrieval of crop biophysical parameters that could be integrated in crop yield simulation models. A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 m resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 m resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield simulations were conducted on a 1.6 × 1.6 km2spatial resolution grid and the results integrated to the county level. The results were within 10{\%} of county yields reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).},

abstract = {Fast, accurate and inexpensive estimates of crop yields at the field scale are useful for many applications. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we recently developed a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that integrates crop simulations with satellite imagery and gridded weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates for multiple crops in different regions. Existing versions of SCYM typically capture one-third to half of the variation in reported county-scale yields. Using rainfed maize in the US Midwest as an example, this study tested multiple approaches for improving SCYM's accuracy, including (i) calibrating the phenology parameters of the crop model (APSIM) used to generate training samples for SCYM; (ii) using an ensemble of three crop models (APSIM-Maize, CERES-Maize, and Hybrid-Maize) instead of a single model; (iii) using simulated biomass from the crop models instead of simulated yields to train SCYM, with the former assuming a constant harvest index (HI). Results show substantial improvement in performance, as assessed using reported county yields by USDA-NASS, both from calibrating APSIM phenology parameters and from training SCYM on simulated biomass rather than yields. Using a multi-model ensemble further improves SCYM, although the benefit is limited. The proposed preferred version of SCYM on average captures 75{\%} of the yield variation for 2001–2015 in the 3I states (i.e. Illinois, Indiana and Iowa) where SCYM is trained, with RMSE typically less than 1 t/ha, and explains 41{\%} to 83{\%} of multi-year yield variations when tested across nine Midwestern US states for 2008–2015. This level of accuracy is particularly notable given that only data from 2014 were used to calibrate phenology parameters. The yield estimates for multiple years in multiple states utilized 1184 Landsat tiles, but could be completed in about 2 h per year by using the GEE platform. All approaches tested in this study do not require any site-specific measurements, and thus can be readily extended to other regions and crops.},

Global maps of these characteristics of the vegetation are presented, and their zonal distribution is discussed. The start of the vegetation cycle has been related to temperature sums in the case of temperate deciduous forest and to precipitation in the case of savannahs. It is concluded that satellite measurements offer interesting perspectives for global-scale quantitative phenology modeling.},

MODIS 16-day 250. m NDVI imagery for the GLB was used in conjunction with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) from 2001, 2006 and 2011, and the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) from 2011 to 2014 to conduct classification evaluations. Inter-class separability was measured by Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distances between selected cover type pairs (both general classes and specific crops), and intra-class variability was measured by calculating simple Euclidean distance for samples within cover types. For the GLB, we found that the application of a smoothing algorithm significantly reduced image noise compared to the raw data. However, the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) measures for smoothed NDVI temporal profiles resulted in large inconsistencies. Of the five algorithms tested, only the Fourier transformation algorithm and Whittaker smoother improved inter-class separability for corn-soybean class pair and significantly improved overall classification accuracy. When compared to the raw NDVI data as input, the overall classification accuracy from the Fourier transformation and Whittaker smoother improved performance by approximately 2-6{\%} for some years. Conversely, the asymmetric Gaussian and double-logistic smoothing algorithms actually led to degradation of classification performance.},

The GRAMI-rice model was parameterized using field data obtained at Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea, in 2011 and 2012. The model was separately validated using field data obtained at the same research site in 2009 and 2010. The model was then integrated into the CIDS to produce two-dimensional (2-D) maps of crop growth and yield. Simulated values of rice growth and yield agreed well with the corresponding measurements in both parameterization and evaluation. The simulated yields were in statistical agreement with the corresponding measured yields according to paired t tests (p=0.415 for parameterization and p=0.939 for validation). The CIDS accurately produced 2-D maps of rice growth and yield. The GRAMI-rice CIDS has simple input requirements and will be useful for regional rice growth monitoring and yield mapping projects.},

abstract = {Monitoring the locations and distributions of land-cover changes is important for establishing links between policy decisions, regulatory actions and subsequent land-use activities. Past studies incorporating two-date change detection using Landsat data have tended to be performance limited for applications in biologically complex systems. This study explored the use of 250 m multi-temporal MODIS NDVI 16-day composite data to provide an automated change detection and alarm capability on a 1 year time-step for the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System (APES) region of the US. Detection accuracy was assessed for 2002 at 88{\%}, with a reasonable balance between change commission errors (21.9{\%}), change omission errors (27.5{\%}), and Kappa coefficient of 0.67. Annual change detection rates across the APES over the study period (2002-2005) were estimated at 0.7{\%} per annum and varied from 0.4{\%} (2003) to 0.9{\%} (2004). Regional variations were also readily apparent ranging from 1.6{\%} to 0.1{\%} per annum for the tidal water and mountain ecological zones, respectfully. This research included the application of an automated protocol to first filter the MODIS NDVI data to remove poor (corrupted) data values and then estimate the missing data values using a discrete Fourier transformation technique to provide high-quality uninterrupted data to support the change detection analysis. The methods and results detailed in this article apply only to non-agricultural areas. Additional limitations attributed to the coarse resolution of the NDVI data included the overestimation of change area that necessitated the application of a change area correction factor. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in monitoring food security is to provide reliable crop yield information that is temporally consistent and spatially scalable. An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and subfield level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000 km2), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000 km2), and wheat in northern India (450,000 km2). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat's sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R2≥ 0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R2{\textgreater} 0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30 m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.},

abstract = {Livestock plays an important economic role in Niger, especially in the semi-arid regions, while being highly vulnerable as a result of the large inter-annual variability of precipitation and, hence, rangeland production. This study aims to support effective rangeland management by developing an approach for mapping rangeland biomass production. The observed spatiotemporal variability of biomass production is utilised to build a model based on ground and remote sensing data for the period 2001 to 2015. Once established, the model can also be used to estimate herbaceous biomass for the current year at the end of the season without the need for new ground data. The phenology-based seasonal cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (cNDVI), computed from 10-day image composites of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, was used as proxy for biomass production. A linear regression model was fitted with multi-annual field measurements of herbaceous biomass at the end of the growing season. In addition to a general model utilising all available sites for calibration, different aggregation schemes (i.e., grouping of sites into calibration units) of the study area with a varying number of calibration units and different biophysical meaning were tested. The sampling sites belonging to a specific calibration unit of a selected scheme were aggregated to compute the regression. The different aggregation schemes were evaluated with respect to their predictive power. The results gathered at the different aggregation levels were subjected to cross-validation (cv), applying a jackknife technique (leaving out one year at a time). In general, the model performance increased with increasing model parameterization, indicating the importance of additional unobserved and spatially heterogeneous agro-ecological effects (which might relate to grazing, species composition, optical soil properties, etc.) in modifying the relationship between cNDVI and herbaceous biomass at the end of the season. The biophysical aggregation scheme, the calibration units for which were derived from an unsupervised ISODATA classification utilising 10-day NDVI images taken between January 2001 and December 2015, showed the best performance in respect to the predictive power (R2cv = 0.47) and the cross-validated root-mean-square error (398 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha−1) values, although it was not the model with the highest number of calibration units. The proposed approach can be applied for the timely production of maps of estimated biomass at the end of the growing season before field measurements are made available. These maps can be used for the improved management of rangeland resources, for decisions on fire prevention and aid allocation, and for the planning of more in-depth field missions.},

abstract = {Vegetation phenological studies at different spatial and temporal scales offer better understanding of the relationship between the global climate and the global distribution of biogeographical zones. These studies in the last few decades have focussed on characterising and understanding vegetation phenology and its drivers especially using satellite sensor data. Nevertheless, despite being home to 17{\%} of the global forest cover, approximately 12{\%} of the world's tropical mangroves, and a diverse range of vegetation types, Africa is one of the most poorly studied regions in the world. There has been no study characterising land surface phenology (LSP) of the major land cover types in the different geographical sub-regions in Africa, and only coarse spatial resolution datasets have been used for continental studies. Therefore, we aim to provide seasonal phenological pattern of Africa's vegetation and characterise the LSP of major land cover types in different geographical sub-regions in Africa at a medium spatial resolution of 500 m using MODIS EVI time-series data over a long temporal range of 15 years (2001–2015). The Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) technique was employed to smooth the time-series data and an inflection point-based method was used to extract phenological parameters such as start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). Homogeneous pixels from 12 years (2001–2012) MODIS land cover data (MODIS MCD12Q1) was used to describe, for the first time, the LSP of the major vegetation types in Africa. The results from this research characterise spatially and temporally the highly irregular and multi-annual variability of the vegetation phenology of Africa, and the maps and charts provide an improved representation of the LSP of Africa, which can serve as a pivot to filling other research gaps in the African continent.},

abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180° providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the noise impedes these data from being further analyzed and used. In this paper, a wavelet-based method is used to remove the contaminated data from time-series observations, which can effectively maintain the temporal pattern and approximate the "true" signals. The method is composed of two steps: (a), time-series values are linearly interpolated with the help of quality flags and the blue band, and (b), time series are decomposed into different scales and the highest correlation among several adjacent scales is used, which is more robust and objective than the threshold-based method. Our objective was to reduce noise in MODIS NDVI, LAI, and Albedo time-series data and to compare this technique with the BISE algorithm, Fourier-based fitting method, and the Savitzky-Golay filter method. The results indicate that our newly developed method enhances the ability to remove noise in all three time-series data products.},

abstract = {In semi-arid areas, a strongly variable climate represents a major risk for food safety. An operational grain yield forecasting system, which could help decision-makers to make early assessments and plan annual imports, is thus needed. It can be challenging to monitor the crop canopy and production capacity of plants, especially cereals. In this context, the aim of the present study is to analyse the characteristics of two types of irrigated and non-irrigated cereals: barley and wheat. Through the use of a rich database, acquired over a period of two years for more than 30 test fields, and from 20 optical satellite SPOT/HRV images, two research approaches are considered. First, statistical analysis is used to characterize the vegetation's dynamics and grain yield, based on remotely sensed (satellite) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements. A relationship is established between the NDVI and LAI (leaf area index). Different robust relationships (exponential or linear) are established between the satellite NDVI index acquired from SPOT/HRV images, just before the time of maximum growth (April), and grain and straw, for barley and wheat vegetation covers. Following validation of the proposed empirical approaches, yield maps are produced for the studied site. The second approach is based on the application of a Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) growth model, developed to simulate the dynamics of the LAI and the grain yield. An inter-comparison between ground yield measurements and SAFY model simulations reveals that yields are underestimated by this model. Finally, the combination of multi-temporal satellite measurements with the SAFY model estimations is also proposed for the purposes of yield mapping. Although the results produced by the SAFY model are found to be reasonably well correlated with those determined by satellite measurements (NDVI), the grain yields are nevertheless underestimated. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Most of current products can partially reach the requirement of high spatial and temporal resolution needed in urban applications. Fortunately, the new generation of satellite in a form of constellation, e.g. Europe's Sentinel-2, China's HJ-1A/B and GF-1/6, is expected to provide more frequent observations ({\textless}1 week) with a higher spatial resolution ({\textless}30 m). Consequently, a proper method should be selected to construct high spatio-temporal time-series NDVI and to derive phenological features for urban applications. In this study, a high spatio-temporal NDVI product for urban scale vegetation time series is conducted based on HJ-1A/B data. Three related issues, i.e. the optimal filter, time series decomposition, phenological features derivation are addressed. In addition, the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the phenological features extraction is also discussed according to the comparison between the derived NDVI product and that extracted from MODIS. The results show that the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is the best filter for the reconstruction of HJ NDVI time series. There is some difference for phenology derivation using “season” and “season + trend” depending on the absence/presence of breakpoints in the curve. The spatial details of phenological features can be built by the high-spatial time-series NDVI, showing a great potential in urban applications. Compared with the MODIS NDVI time series, HJ NDVI time series can get more detail information than overall phenological features because of its high spatio-temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP) provides bio-indication of ongoing climate change. It uses space-borne greenness proxies to monitor plant phenology at the landscape level from the regional to global scale. However, several unconsidered methodological and observational -related limitations may lead to misinterpretation of the satellite-derived signals. For instance, changes in species composition within a pixel could result in a change in the time series of the greenness proxy, due to the distinct phenology of the plant species involved. The change in the signal would then be misinterpreted as a phenological change while it is actually related to changes in species composition within the pixel. Other limitations include the selection of the smoothing technique and the method used to extract the LSP metrics. These not only may affect the timing of the LSP metrics but also the sign of the observed LSP change. Another and much less known limitation is related to the mixed signal from multi-canopy layers. Satellites may detect changes that corresponds to the understorey layer in complex vertical vegetation systems while the ‘real' contribution of this layer (in terms of ecosystem functioning and dynamics) might be small compared to the undetected overstorey layer in cases of a late overstorey development. Here, some of the LSP basics are reviewed with emphasis on these (and other) potential sources of misinterpretation. Several aids to overcome these limitations, which include suggestions for multi methods analysis and the integration of information from satellite and ground-based sensors are provided alongside some prospective future LSP research directions.},

abstract = {The emergence of satellite sensors that can routinely observe millions of individual smallholder farms raises possibilities for monitoring and understanding agricultural productivity in many regions of the world. Here we demonstrate the potential to track smallholder maize yield variation in western Kenya, using a combination of 1-m Terra Bella imagery and intensive field sampling on thousands of fields over 2 y. We find that agreement between satellite-based and traditional field survey-based yield estimates depends significantly on the quality of the field-based measures, with agreement highest ([Formula: see text] up to 0.4) when using precise field measures of plot area and when using larger fields for which rounding errors are smaller. We further show that satellite-based measures are able to detect positive yield responses to fertilizer and hybrid seed inputs and that the inferred responses are statistically indistinguishable from estimates based on survey-based yields. These results suggest that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to make predictions of smallholder agricultural productivity that are roughly as accurate as the survey-based measures traditionally used in research and policy applications, and they indicate a substantial near-term potential to quickly generate useful datasets on productivity in smallholder systems, even with minimal or no field training data. Such datasets could rapidly accelerate learning about which interventions in smallholder systems have the most positive impact, thus enabling more rapid transformation of rural livelihoods.},

abstract = {Although the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data, derived from NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/VEGETATION, TERRA or AQUA/MODIS, has been successfully used in research regarding global environmental change, residual noise in the NDVI time-series data, even after applying strict pre-processing, impedes further analysis and risks generating erroneous results. Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Current models of vegetation dynamics using the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) time series perform poorly for high-latitude environments. This is due partly to specific attributes of these environments, such as short growing season, long periods of darkness in winter, persistence of snow cover, and dominance of evergreen species, but also to the design of the models. We present a new method for monitoring vegetation activity at high latitudes, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. It estimates the NDVI of the vegetation during winter and applies a double logistic function, which is uniquely defined by six parameters that describe the yearly NDVI time series. Using NDVI data from 2000 to 2004, we illustrate the performance of this method for an area in northern Scandinavia (35 × 162 km2, 68° N 23° E) and compare it to existing methods based on Fourier series and asymmetric Gaussian functions. The double logistic functions describe the NDVI data better than both the Fourier series and the asymmetric Gaussian functions, as quantified by the root mean square errors. Compared with the method based on Fourier series, the new method does not overestimate the duration of the growing season. In addition, it handles outliers effectively and estimates parameters that are related to phenological events, such as the timing of spring and autumn. This makes the method most suitable for both estimating biophysical parameters and monitoring vegetation phenology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm has been widely used to reconstruct time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Leaf area index (LAI), and land surface temperature (LST) as well as the polarization difference brightness temperature (PDBT) during the past 20. years to remove random noise or eliminate cloud/snow contamination. So far no systematic study on the accuracy of such reconstruction has been done. This study aims at taking the global MODIS vegetation index as an example to develop a generic method to evaluate the reconstruction performance of HANTS. The overall reconstruction error was divided into gap related error and fitting-method related error. Firstly, ten annual NDVI time series for a pixel were used to extract reference series and gap statistics. Then the gap and fitting-method related errors were quantified independently. The results suggest that the gap related error for most of the high latitude forest area (between 50°N and 70°N) was rather large (the mean root mean squared deviation (RMSD) reached to 0.15), which may be attributed to the fact that large gaps appear in the NDVI profiles between snow melting and vegetation regreening season. The gap related error was found negligible for the other areas of the globe except the North China Plain, the North India and several mountainous areas where the mean RMSD is around 0.1. The inadequate capability of low frequency harmonics to capture the rapid transition during snowmelt in spring at the high latitude region of the North Hemisphere makes the fitting-method related error in this region rather large (RMSD can reach 0.1). The method developed in this study was applied to map globally the spatial pattern of HANTS performance in the reconstruction of NDVI time series and it can also be applied to evaluate the reconstruction performance of time series of other land surface variables or the performance of other time series reconstruction algorithms.},

abstract = {New advances in satellite data acquisition and processing offer promise for monitoring agricultural lands globally. Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the "best" dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14-58{\%} and an average of 35{\%} for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32{\%} of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.},

abstract = {We used land surface temperature (LST) algorithms and NDVI values to estimate changes in vegetation in the European continent between 1982 and 1999 from the Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) dataset. These two parameters are monitored through HANTS (Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series) software, which allows the simultaneous observation of mean value, first harmonic amplitude and phase behaviors in the same image. These results for each complete year of data show the effect of volcanic aerosols and orbital drift on PAL data. Comparison of time series of HANTS cloud-free time series with the original time series for various land cover proves that this software is useful for LST analysis, although primarily designed for NDVI applications. Comparison of yearly averages of HANTS LST over the whole Europe with air temperature confirms the validity of the results. Maps of the evolution for both parameters between periods 1982/1986 and 1995/1999 have been elaborated: NDVI data show the well confirmed trend of increase over Europe (up to 0.1 in NDVI), Southern Europe seeing a decrease in NDVI (- 0.02). LST averages stay stable or slightly decrease (up to - 1.5 K) over the whole continent, except for southern areas for which the increase is up to 2.5 K. These results evidence that arid and semi-arid areas of Southern Europe have become more arid, the rest of Europe seeing an increase in its wood land proportion, while seasonal amplitude in Northern Europe has decreased. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop production in the food insecure regions of West Africa. The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.},

abstract = {PhenoSat is an experimental software tool that produces phenological information from satellite vegetation index time series. The main characteristics and functionalities of the PhenoSat tool are presented, and its performance is compared against observed measures and other available software applications. A multiyear experiment was carried out for different vegetation types: vineyard, low shrublands, and seminatural meadows. Temporal satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data provided by MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION were used to test the ability of the software in extracting vegetation dynamics information. Three important PhenoSat features were analyzed: extraction of the main growing season information, estimation of double growth season parameters, and the advantage of selecting a temporal region of interest. Seven noise reduction filters were applied: cubic smoothing splines, polynomial curve fitting, Fourier series, Gaussian models, piecewise logistic, Savitzky-Golay (SG), and a combination of the last two. The results showed that PhenoSat is a useful tool to extract NDVI metrics related to vegetation dynamics, obtaining high significant correlations between observed and estimated parameters for most of the phenological stages and vegetation types studied. Using the combination of SG and piecewise logistic to fit the NDVI time series, PhenoSat obtained correlations higher than 0.71, except for the seminatural meadow start of season. The selection of a temporal region of interest improved the fitting process, consequently providing more reliable phenological information. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Presently, the most common method for the estimation of sowing dates in West African countries consists of applying given thresholds on rainfall estimations. However, the coarse spatial resolution and the possible inaccuracy of these estimations are limiting factors. In this context, the remote sensing approach, which consists of deriving green-up onset dates from satellite remote sensing data, appears as an interesting alternative. It builds upon a novel statistic model that translates vegetation onset detections derived from MODIS time series into sowing probabilities at the village level. Results for Niger show that this approach outperforms the standard method adopted in the region based on rainfall thresholds.},

We examine maize and soybean yields for 2000–2015 in the Midwestern U.S. using a new satellite-based dataset on crop yields at 30m resolution. We quantify heterogeneity both within and between fields, and find that the difference between average and top yielding fields is typically below 30{\%} for both maize and soybean, as expected in advanced agricultural regions. In most counties, within-field heterogeneity is at least half as large as overall heterogeneity, illustrating the importance of non-management factors such as soil and landscape position. Surprisingly, we find that yield heterogeneity is rising in maize, both between and within fields, with average yield differences between the best and worst soils more than doubling since 2000. Heterogeneity trends were insignificant for soybean. The findings are consistent both with recent adoption of precision agriculture technologies and with recent trends toward denser sowing in maize, which disproportionately raise yields on better soils. The results imply that yield gains in the region are increasingly derived from the more productive land, and that sub-field precision management of nutrients and other inputs is increasingly warranted.},

In this paper, we compared the phenology of rangeland vs cropped land in the Sahel belt of Africa, using the only currently available global phenology product (MODIS MCD12Q2 - Land Cover Dynamics Yearly), and an enhanced crop mask of Mali. The differences in terms of start-of-season (SOS) are spatially (north south gradient), and temporally (10 years, 2001-2009) analyzed in bioclimatic terms. Our results show that globally the MODIS MCD12Q2 SOS dates of croplands and rangelands differ, and that these differences depend on the bioclimatic zone. In Sahelian and Guinean regions, cropland vegetation begins to grow earlier than rangeland vegetation (8-day and 4-day advance, respectively). Between, in the Sudanian and Sudano-Sahelian parts of Mali, rangeland vegetation greens about one week earlier than croplands. These results are discussed in the context of the land surface heterogeneity at MODIS scale, and in the context of the natural vegetation ecology.

abstract = {Land cover change can be assessed from ground measurements or remotely sensed data. As regards remotely sensed data, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) parameter, the presence of atmospherically contaminated data in the time series introduces some noise that may blur the change analysis. Several methods have already been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series, although most methods have been dedicated to reconstruction of acquired time series, while publicly available databases are usually composited over time. This paper presents the IDR (iterative Interpolation for Data Reconstruction) method, a new method designed to approximate the upper envelope of the NDVI time series while conserving as much as possible of the original data. This method is compared quantitatively to two previously applied methods to NDVI time series over different land cover classes. The IDR method provides the best profile reconstruction in most cases. Nevertheless, the IDR method tends to overestimate low NDVI values when high rates of change are present, although this effect can be lowered with shorter compositing periods. This method could also be applied to data before compositing, as well as to reconstruct time series for other biophysical parameters such as land surface temperature, as long as atmospheric contamination affects these parameters negatively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In recent decades, researchers have developed methods and models to reconstruct time series of irregularly spaced observations from satellite remote sensing, among which the widely used Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) method. Many studies based on time series reconstructed with HANTS documented the excellent performance of this method. While some limitations of HANTS have been noticed in these applications, there is no dedicated study on a systematic evaluation on the performance of the HANTS method. In this study, we evaluated the impact of gaps on the time series reconstruction of NDVI by HANTS. For global representativeness, a simulated NDVI time series dataset was constructed for four generic patterns and was applied as a reference dataset. Then random gaps were introduced into the reference series and both the reference and gapped series were reconstructed by harmonic analysis. The deviations between the two reconstructed results were used to evaluate statistically the accuracy of harmonic analysis under different gap conditions. The size of maximum gap (MGS), the number of loss (NL) and the number of gaps (NG) were selected to parameterize the gap distribution. The results showed that MGS, NL and NG were significant factors in the process of reconstruction and the two terminals and the peak of the series are crucial positions. MGS and NL should not be too large in the time series for all seasonal or non-seasonal case; otherwise the reconstructed series is not reliable. These conclusions can be taken as a reference to indicate the reliability of HANTS for particular cases towards the definition of a quality indicator of any time series.},

abstract = {Management of crops is an essential part in the food production procedure. Having a thorough knowledge of growth stages of each crop is of paramount importance in this respect. Phenology (transplanting, panicle formation, flowering etc) is the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena that are controlled by environmental and climatic factors. Monitoring the crop condition manually in the field is difficult and time consuming. Therefore recently, several methods have been introduced by using satellite derived vegetation indices. Extraction of phenological parameters is helpful for the purposes like irrigation management, nutrient management, health management, yield prediction and crop type mapping. Easily extracted parameters will be the important data base for agricultural researchers. This research is an attempt to extract paddy phenological parameters of Sri Lanka by using 16 years' (2000 to 2015) Time series MODIS Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is highly sensitive for the green vegetation and the data were analysed using SPIRITS and TIMESAT software's. Periodicity converter in SPIRITS and Savitzky Golay filtering in TIMESAT and SPIRITS are helpful in smoothing the time series which are perturbed by noise due to missing values and Clouds. Phenology is considered as a sensitive climate change indicator but, it is very essential to have a comprehensive familiarity about the method of water supply that the study area is irrigated or rain fed so as to eliminate the wrong interpretation. As results, average of long time series of NDVI profile for a few agro ecological zones of Sri Lanka with extracted seven parameters (Start of the season, End of the season, Length of the season, Booting date, Base value, Maximum NDVI during the Season, Amplitude) and generated phenological parameter maps are presented here. The crop phenology is a very important element of agricultural monitoring, to ensure the security of the food crop production.},

abstract = {Vegetation typically elicits dynamics at the seasonal and annual level. Time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets, such as the pathfinder AVHRR land (PAL) NDVI dataset, have proven to be appropriate for the detection of long-term vegetation cover changes. It has been applied in modelling experiments for terrestrial ecosystems at the global, continental, and regional scales. But some PAL NDVI time series remain significant residual effects and noise levels. A simple method, the mean-value iteration filter (MVI), has been developed to reduce the noise and to enable the reconstruction of high quality NDVI time-series. A comparison between the newly developed method and other existing methods (the modified BISE algorithm and a fast Fourier transform algorithm) indicates that the newly developed method is an effective tool for reconstructing high-quality time series of PAL NDVI time series. {\textcopyright} 2005 COSPAR.},

The green wave effect is charted by using the relatively homogeneous rangeland vegetation systems of the Mixed Prairie region in the central United States as phenological indicators. ERTS multispectral scanner data and ground observations collected from the network of ten test sites are used to measure vegetation changes during the life-time of ERTS-1. Attention is given to observing seasonal drought and other bioclimatic influences which impact upon management and production in agriculture. The overall objective of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of ERTS-type data in monitoring the vegetation conditions of direct concern to rangeland management and agri-business decisions in this region.},

@article{Sibley2014a,
abstract = {For remote sensing to be useful for analyzing crop yield gaps, methods should be accurate at the field scale without need for local ground calibration. We used an extensive field-level data set of on-farm yields from 134 irrigated and 94 rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) fields in Nebraska during a 4-yr period to evaluate three methods that do not require ground-based calibration. The first method is based on summing estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, the second on using either MODIS or Landsat data to calibrate a crop model (Hybrid-Maize), and the third using Hybrid-Maize simulations to train a simple regression, which is then applied to MODIS or Landsat data. For MODIS, all three methods performed similarly poorly at predicting maize yields, with an R-2 between observed and predicted yields of roughly 0.10 for rainfed and 0.20 for irrigated fields. Estimates from Landsat were considerably more accurate, with up to 20{\%} of rainfed and 50{\%} of irrigated yield variation captured by the predictions. Across all methods and sensors, irrigated yield variations were more successfully captured than rainfed yields because of relatively smaller rainfed field sizes and the added difficulty of modeling crop water stress in rainfed fields. Agreement between observed and predicted yields was highest for the third approach, which is attractive because it leverages a crop model's ability to synthesize knowledge on crop physiology and year-to-year differences in weather throughout the season, yet produces a simple regression that can be rapidly applied to Landsat imagery.},

@article{Johnson2016,
abstract = {Crop yield forecast models for barley, canola and spring wheat grown on the Canadian Prairies were developed using vegetation indices derived from satellite data and machine learning methods. Hierarchical clustering was used to group the crop yield data from 40 Census Agricultural Regions (CARs) into several larger regions for building the forecast models. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and NDVI derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were considered as predictors for crop yields. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and two nonlinear machine learning models - Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB) - were used to forecast crop yields, with various combinations of MODIS-NDVI, MODIS-EVI and NOAA-NDVI as predictors. Crop yield forecasts made using predictors from July and earlier were evaluated by the cross-validated mean absolute error skill score (in reference to climatological forecasts) during 2000-2011. While MODIS-NDVI was found to be the most effective predictor for all three crops, having MODIS-EVI as an additional predictor enhanced the forecast skills. While MLR, BNN and MOB all showed significantly higher skills than climatological forecasts for all three crops, barley was the only case where the nonlinear BNN and MOB models showed slightly higher skills than MLR. The lack of skill improvement by nonlinear models over MLR is likely due to the short (12 years) record available for MODIS data, which limits our study to 2000-2011, with very low yields coming from a single severe drought year (2002).},

@article{Marteau2011,
abstract = {A multi-year (2004-2009) field survey of on-farm sowing practices in 10 villages located in south-west Niger close to Niamey, is analysed to investigate the relationships (i) between rainfall and the sowing date of pearl millet and the risk of sowing failure, (ii) between sowing and meteorological/agro-climatic onset dates, (iii) between sowing/onset dates, and simulated and observed yield/biomass at the end of the season. Even if some villages sow without any synchronous or anterior rainfall, most parcels (73{\%} out of the 1551 available cases) are sown during and just after a 2-day wet spell receiving at least 10 mm. In fact, there is a strong correlation (r= 0.82-0.95 depending on onset definition) between the spatial averages of onset and of sowing dates. Most of the failed sowings (≈22{\%} of total sowings) are related to dry spells lasting at least 7 days after an initial 2-day wet spell receiving less than 10 mm. Simulations with the "Syst{\`{e}}me d'Analyse R{\'{e}}gionale des Risques Agronomiques - version Habill{\'{e}}e" crop model show that the ideal sowing date, retrospectively computed as the one maximizing simulated yield, is on average about 6 days later than the observed one. Despite the large inter-village variance and the relatively weak inter-annual signal in onset dates and seasonal amounts, there is a tendency for weaker yields and especially weaker amounts of biomass for late onset. But crop simulations show that sowing very early, as for example during or just after the first wet spell when at least 90{\%} of rainfall stations receive simultaneously at least 1 mm in two consecutive days (i.e. meteorological onset), does not necessarily maximize simulated yield because of the high risk of long-lasting post-onset dry spells. The farmers' strategy, that is sowing their field during or just after the first significant wet spell, is combined with the use of photoperiodic varieties to provide the best-suited response to the temporal and spatial variability of onset of the rainy season. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
